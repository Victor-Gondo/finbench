"How did AWS GenAI launches, record Prime speed, and segment rev. increases drive 2024 margin gains?",,"AWS GenAI launches, record Prime speed improvements, and strong segment revenue increases all contributed to Amazon’s significant margin gains in 2024. AWS’s introduction of new AI infrastructure, models, and services boosted its segment revenue by 19% YoY (from $91B to $108B), driving higher-margin growth. Expanded selection, lower prices, and record shipping speeds for Prime members made the Stores segment more attractive, supporting North America (up 10% YoY) and International (up 9% YoY) revenue gains. Altogether, these advances resulted in operating income improving 86% YoY, from $36.9B to $68.6B, and operating margin rising from 6.4% to 10.8%.","Dear Shareholders:
2024 was a strong year for Amazon.
Our total revenue grew 11% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $575B to $638B. By segment, North America
revenue increased 10% Y oY from $353B to $387B, International revenue grew 9% Y oY from $131B to $143B,
and AWS revenue increased 19% Y oY , from $91B to $108B. For perspective, just 10 years ago, AWS
revenue was $4.6B; and in that same year, Amazon’s total revenue was $89B.
Amazon’s operating income in 2024 improved 86% Y oY , from $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%) to
$68.6B (an operating margin of 10.8%). Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved
from $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.
Apart from the financial results, we made our customers’ lives meaningfully better and easier. In our Stores
business, we substantially expanded selection, continued lowering prices (independent research firm,
Profitero, found Amazon the lowest-priced online U.S. Retailer for the eighth year in a row), and for the
second year in a row, we shipped at record speed to our Prime members. AWS launched a slew of new
infrastructure and AI services that make it even easier to build remarkable customer experiences, including
our latest custom AI silicon (Trainium2), a new set of frontier foundation models in Amazon Nova, and
significant expansion of available models and features in our leading Generative AI (“GenAI”) services
Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Prime Video continued to offer compelling original shows,
including new seasons forFallout, Reacher, The Boys,and The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, movies like
Road House, The Idea of You,and Red One, live sports likeThursday Night Footballand UEFA Champions
League in Europe (with the NBA and NASCAR coming in 2025), and new selection, highlighted by Apple
TV+ joining Prime Video Channels. We launched a series of new Kindle devices that included a new color
version, a larger Scribe option, and our fastest Paperwhites ever (the collection of which drove the highest
Kindle unit sales for a single quarter in over a decade). And, we continued to add more selection, price
transparency, and same day shipping for Amazon Pharmacy.
These accomplishments are a subset of what the team launched in 2024, but represent a lot of invention,
hard work, and thoughtful execution across Amazon. I’m thankful for my teammates and their delivery this
past year (some of which you can see in our 2024 results, others of which won’t be visible for the next
few years).
A Why Culture
Every year in my annual letter, I try to share insight into what makes Amazon tick. At the highest level,
we’re aiming to be Earth’s most customer-centric company, making customers’ lives better and easier every
day. This is not easy to do in general, let alone year after year. In fact, it’s actually quite hard, especially with
the rapid rate of change in technology, customer habits, and new products from large and small companies
alike. If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything
around us.
We’ve had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way
door decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where
you were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. Y ou can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-
way door decision is one where it’s quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if
you get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs
assume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed
bolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we’ve found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors
has been a simple question: “Why?”|in one day (or better). An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is
primarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and
the introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we’ve set speed records for two
consecutive years, we’re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don’t forget Prime Air,
our drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.
Why can’t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?
As some other companies are abandoning small-town customers due to cost to serve, we’re going the other
way—we’re investing to serve our rural customers even better. We’ve already expanded Same-Day and
Overnight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion
will provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less
densely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in
13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.
Related, why can’t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?
There are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don’t have
access to broadband connectivity. They can’t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access
entertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is
what Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We’re just launching our first
production satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-
intensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.
Why does healthcare have to be so stressful?
Healthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It’s hard to get fast appointments with primary care
physicians, often harder with specialists. There’s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes
with patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when
they get to the pharmacy, they’re often surprised by the pricing, what’s covered by their insurance, and what
you can easily access that’s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It’s why you see such
positive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue
to iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for
One Medical.
These are some of the Why questions we’re asking ourselves right now, and I’m excited about the future
inventions to come. We’re not going to be bored any time soon.
When I first started working, I thought it was unfathomable that my Dad worked at the same place for
45 years. How could that be? That’s so long. I used to tell my friends that would never be me. Now, with almost
28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question.
After all these years, why are you still at Amazon?
I’m obviously a Superfan, but there are several compelling parts to working at Amazon. First, I’m not sure
that any company prioritizes customers as relentlessly as we do. Lots of companies say they will; few follow
through. Second, it’s challenging to find a company where you can make a bigger impact on the world
than you can at Amazon. Third, we make significant long-term investments and bets in both inventions and
people. This allows our teams to iterate on ideas, and make the right long-term decisions for customers
and the company. And, I’ve never encountered a more intelligent, creative, ambitious, hungry, hard-working,
and missionary group of teammates than we have at Amazon. In my opinion, this is a remarkable set of
qualities to have at a company. And, for builders who want to change the world, and who have fire in their
belly, there’s no better place to be than Amazon.|Infrastructure
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased
traffic, sales, and service levels:
• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our
management team.
• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our
Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.
• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.
• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in
May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.
Our Employees
The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in
being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the
single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.
It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at
Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something
that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to
be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion
build Amazon.com.
Goals for 1998
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet
commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.
This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,
selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we
believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to
better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.
To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in
prioritizing our investments.
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have
so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The
challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:
aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of
product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market
opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to
be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about
what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and
trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

How did Amazon’s expansion of Same-Day and Overnight Delivery affect speed in rural vs. urban areas?,,"Amazon’s expansion of Same-Day and Overnight Delivery significantly improved delivery speeds in rural areas, making them more comparable to those in urban locations. While many companies are reducing service to small towns due to cost, Amazon invested in expanding fast delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S. As a result, millions of customers in less densely populated areas now benefit from faster Amazon delivery, enabling over a billion packages each year to be delivered to customers in 13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.

• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in
May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.
Our Employees
The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in
being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the
single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.
It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at
Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something
that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to
be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion
build Amazon.com.
Goals for 1998
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet
commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.
This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,
selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we
believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to
better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.
To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in
prioritizing our investments.
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have
so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The
challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:
aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of
product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market
opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to
be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about
what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and
trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

"Analyze how regionalization, placement algorithms, and drones together drive faster Amazon delivery in both urban and rural areas.",,"Regionalization redesigns Amazon's fulfillment network so inventory is stored closer to customers, reducing transit times. Placement algorithms optimize where products are stocked, ensuring high-demand items are positioned for rapid dispatch. Drones (Prime Air) further accelerate last-mile delivery, with the ability to bring items to customers within an hour. Together, these innovations have enabled faster deliveries—including same-day and overnight—even in rural areas, as Amazon continues expanding these capabilities beyond cities to reach millions more customers efficiently.","in one day (or better). An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is
primarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and
the introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we’ve set speed records for two
consecutive years, we’re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don’t forget Prime Air,
our drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.
Why can’t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?
As some other companies are abandoning small-town customers due to cost to serve, we’re going the other
way—we’re investing to serve our rural customers even better. We’ve already expanded Same-Day and
Overnight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion
will provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less
densely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in
13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.
Related, why can’t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?
There are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don’t have
access to broadband connectivity. They can’t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access
entertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is
what Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We’re just launching our first
production satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-
intensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.
Why does healthcare have to be so stressful?
Healthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It’s hard to get fast appointments with primary care
physicians, often harder with specialists. There’s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes
with patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when
they get to the pharmacy, they’re often surprised by the pricing, what’s covered by their insurance, and what
you can easily access that’s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It’s why you see such
positive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue
to iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for
One Medical.

Analyze the economic and societal impacts of satellite internet for remote indigenous and nomadic populations.,,"Satellite internet, such as Amazon’s Project Kuiper, can have significant economic and societal impacts for remote indigenous and nomadic populations. Economically, providing broadband connectivity enables these communities to access online markets, education, telemedicine, and remote work, which can drive income growth and reduce isolation from broader economic opportunities. Societally, satellite internet helps bridge the digital divide—giving hundreds of millions of households, particularly in rural areas, access to information, communication, and services previously unavailable.

Analyze the influence of Amazon's rapid global fulfillment center rollout on 1997 international market penetration.,,"In 1997, Amazon's global fulfillment center expansion primarily focused on increasing domestic capacity, with distribution center space growing from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including the launch of a second center in Delaware. This infrastructure growth enhanced inventory availability and improved service for existing customers. However, while Amazon recognized significant future opportunities to better serve international customers—such as reducing delivery times and tailoring experiences—the 1997 rollout did not specifically drive international market penetration. Instead, the foundation built in 1997 positioned Amazon to pursue international growth in later years by enabling faster, more reliable fulfillment and supporting broader global ambitions.","Infrastructure
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased
traffic, sales, and service levels:
• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our
management team.
• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our
Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.
• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.
• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in
May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.
Our Employees
The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in
being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the
single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.
It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at
Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something
that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to
be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion
build Amazon.com.
Goals for 1998
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet
commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.
This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,
selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we
believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to
better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.
To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in
prioritizing our investments.
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have
so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The
challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:
aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of
product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market
opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to
be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about
what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and
trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we
will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.

the present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.
• We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent
competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational
long-term leadership investments.
• We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of
continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.

We aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we
would be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.
With this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our
outlook for the future.
Obsess Over Customers
From the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the
Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply
could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than
was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-
to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged
focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer
customers gift certificates, 1-Click
SM shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and
recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth
remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers
have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader
in online bookselling.
By many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:
• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.
• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.
• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to
over 58% in the same period in 1997.
• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the
top 20.
• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America
Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.|1997 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
(Reprinted from the 1997 Annual Report)
To our shareholders:
Amazon.com passed many milestones in 1997: by year-end, we had served more than 1.5 million customers,
yielding 838% revenue growth to $147.8 million, and extended our market leadership despite aggressive
competitive entry.
But this is Day 1 for the Internet and, if we execute well, for Amazon.com. Today, online commerce saves
customers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the
very process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,
hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.
We have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity
and as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive
landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings
and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move
quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities
in other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not without
risk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.
It’s All About the Long Term
We believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over thelong
term. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.
The stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translate
directly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns on
invested capital.
Our decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most
indicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue to
purchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to invest
aggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish an
enduring franchise.
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than
some companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-making
approach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:
• We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.
• We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations
rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.
• We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to
jettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that work
best. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.",./dataset_2/earningscall\2024-Shareholder-Letter-Final.pdf
Assess the impact of rapid international recruitment and logistics expansion on Amazon's 1997 operational resilience.,,"Rapid international recruitment and logistics expansion in 1997 significantly strengthened Amazon's operational resilience. The employee base expanded from 158 to 614, greatly enhancing management capacity and enabling the company to handle increased traffic, sales, and service demands. Additionally, distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a new center in Delaware and major expansion in Seattle. These moves improved inventory availability (over 200,000 titles year-end) and customer service, allowing Amazon to better absorb growth challenges and execution risks. Overall, these investments positioned Amazon to sustain rapid growth and maintain market leadership despite aggressive competition.","Infrastructure
During 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased
traffic, sales, and service levels:
• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our
management team.
• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our
Seattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.
• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.
• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in
May 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.
Our Employees
The past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in
being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the
single most important element of Amazon.com’s success.
It’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at
Amazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, something
that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant to
be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion
build Amazon.com.
Goals for 1998
We are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet
commerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.
This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,
selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we
believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to
better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.
To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in
prioritizing our investments.
We now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have
so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The
challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:
aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of
product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market
opportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to
be a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good about
what we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.
1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and
trust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.

"How did Amazon’s 1997 infrastructure expansion, hiring growth, and capital allocation target long-term market leadership?",,"Amazon’s 1997 infrastructure expansion, hiring growth, and capital allocation were all explicitly aimed at achieving long-term market leadership. The company expanded its distribution center capacity from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet and increased inventory to over 200,000 titles, improving customer availability and service. The employee base grew from 158 to 614, strengthening the management team and supporting rapid business growth. Significant capital was secured ($125 million at year-end) from both an IPO and a loan, providing strategic flexibility for ongoing investment.

These efforts supported Amazon’s strategy to prioritize growth, customer focus, and scale over near-term profitability, with the belief that establishing market leadership would yield higher revenue and long-term shareholder value. As stated in the context, Amazon prioritized investments that could lead to market leadership, even at the cost of short-term financial results, and was willing to make bold moves to solidify its position in the emerging online retail sector.","Infrastructure

How do Meta’s Q1 Family of Apps user growth and revenue YoY % compare to previous years?,,"In Q1, Meta’s Family of Apps daily active users reached over 3.4 billion, and revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $41.9 billion. This marks a strong performance compared to previous years, with both user base and revenue showing healthy double-digit growth; user engagement and ad revenue, in particular, were driven by improvements in content recommendation and video consumption.","5 
 
Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 
billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March.  
 
Q1 Total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9 billion, up 16% year over year.  
 
Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $41.4 billion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis.  
 
Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year -over-year 
growth.  
 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and North America 
at 19% and 18%, respectively. Europe and Asia-Pacific grew 14% and 12%. 
 
In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 5% and the average 
price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific. Pricing growth 
benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was 
partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.  
 
Family of Apps other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by business messaging 
revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions.  
We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of 
our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our 
overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 10%, mainly due t o growth in employee 
compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower legal -related 
expenses. 
 
Family of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin.  
Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year -over-year due to 
lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray -Ban Meta AI 
glasses.  
 
Reality Labs expenses were $4.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven primarily by higher 
employee compensation. 
 
Reality Labs operating loss was $4.2 billion. 
 
Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue 
performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness 
at monetizing that engagement over time.   
 
On the first, we’re focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps today and building the next 
generation of devices and experiences through Reality Labs. I’ll start with our Family of Apps.   
 
In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in video consumption across both Facebook and 
Instagram, particularly in the US where video time spent grew double digits year -over-year.  
 
This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing enhancements to our recommendation 
systems, and we see opportunities to deliver further gains this year. We’re also progressing on 
longer-term efforts to develop innovative new approaches to recommend ations.|6 
 
A big focus of this work will be on developing increasingly efficient recommendation systems so 
that we can continue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models while 
avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we’re wor king on that will 
incorporate the innovations from LLM model architectures to achieve this.  
 
Another area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology into our content 
recommendations systems. For example, we’re finding that LLMs’ ability to understand a piece of 
content more deeply than traditional recommendation systems can help b etter identify what is 
interesting to someone about a piece of content, leading to better recommendations. We began 
testing using Llama in Threads recommendation systems at the end of last year given the app’s 
text-based content, and have already seen a 4% lift in time spent from the first launch. It remains 
early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content 
types, including photos and videos.  
 
We also expect this to be complimentary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to 
people’s queries by better understanding their interests and preferences through their 
interactions across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Earlier this year, we began testing the 
ability for Meta AI to better personalize its responses by remembering certain details from 
people’s prior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We are already 
seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we’ve rolled it out to, and it is now built into 
Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and our new standalone Meta AI app in the US 
and Canada. 
 
We’re also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In Q1, we launched a new 
experience on Instagram in the US that consists of a Feed of content your friends have left a note 
on or liked, and we’re seeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in 
experience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels algorithm with your friends to 
spark conversations over each other’s interests. These features all lean into Instagram’s position 
at the intersection of entertainment and social connection. WhatsApp remains at its core a private

accounts they are connected to or follow. Today, there are tens of billions of views of Status p osts 
on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the Updates tab as a place people can go to 
do more. 
 
Creators remain another big focus for us, and we’re investing in tools to help them produce the 
best original content on our platforms. Last week, we launched our standalone Edits app, which 
supports the full creative process for video creators - from inspiration and creation to 
performance insights. Edits has an ultra-high resolution short-form video camera and includes 
generative AI tools that enable people to remove the background of any video or animate still 
images, with more features coming soon. 
 
Moving to Reality Labs. We’re seeing very strong traction with Ray -Ban Meta AI glasses, with over 
4x as many monthly actives as a year ago, and the number of people using voice commands is

fully rolled out live translations on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses to all markets for English, French, 
Italian, and Spanish. Now, when you are speaking to someone in one of these languages, you’ll 
hear what they say in your preferred language through the glasses in real time.

How did deploying Llama LLM in Threads impact both content recommendation efficiency and user time spent?,,"Deploying Llama LLM in Threads improved content recommendation efficiency by enabling deeper understanding of content, which led to better personalized recommendations. As a result, there was a 4% increase in user time spent on Threads following the initial launch of Llama in its recommendation systems.","5 
 
Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow, and we estimate more than 3.4 
billion people used at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March.  
 
Q1 Total Family of Apps revenue was $41.9 billion, up 16% year over year.  
 
Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $41.4 billion, up 16% or 20% on a constant currency basis.  
 
Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year -over-year 
growth.  
 
On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and North America 
at 19% and 18%, respectively. Europe and Asia-Pacific grew 14% and 12%. 
 
In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 5% and the average 
price per ad increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific. Pricing growth 
benefited from increased advertiser demand, in part driven by improved ad performance. This was 
partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing regions and surfaces.  
 
Family of Apps other revenue was $510 million, up 34%, driven mostly by business messaging 
revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business Platform as well as Meta Verified subscriptions.  
We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of 
our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $20.1 billion, representing 81% of our 
overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 10%, mainly due t o growth in employee 
compensation and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower legal -related 
expenses. 
 
Family of Apps operating income was $21.8 billion, representing a 52% operating margin.  
Within our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $412 million, down 6% year -over-year due to 
lower Meta Quest sales, which were partially offset by increased sales of Ray -Ban Meta AI 
glasses.  
 
Reality Labs expenses were $4.6 billion, up 8% year-over-year driven primarily by higher 
employee compensation. 
 
Reality Labs operating loss was $4.2 billion. 
 
Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue 
performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness 
at monetizing that engagement over time.   
 
On the first, we’re focused both on enhancing our core Family of Apps today and building the next 
generation of devices and experiences through Reality Labs. I’ll start with our Family of Apps.   
 
In the first quarter, we saw strong growth in video consumption across both Facebook and 
Instagram, particularly in the US where video time spent grew double digits year -over-year.  
 
This growth continues to be driven primarily by ongoing enhancements to our recommendation 
systems, and we see opportunities to deliver further gains this year. We’re also progressing on 
longer-term efforts to develop innovative new approaches to recommend ations.|6 
 
A big focus of this work will be on developing increasingly efficient recommendation systems so 
that we can continue scaling up the complexity and compute used to train our models while 
avoiding diminishing returns. There are promising techniques we’re wor king on that will 
incorporate the innovations from LLM model architectures to achieve this.  
 
Another area that is showing early promise is integrating LLM technology into our content 
recommendations systems. For example, we’re finding that LLMs’ ability to understand a piece of 
content more deeply than traditional recommendation systems can help b etter identify what is 
interesting to someone about a piece of content, leading to better recommendations. We began 
testing using Llama in Threads recommendation systems at the end of last year given the app’s 
text-based content, and have already seen a 4% lift in time spent from the first launch. It remains 
early here, but a big focus this year will be on exploring how we can deploy this for other content 
types, including photos and videos.  
 
We also expect this to be complimentary to Meta AI as it can provide more relevant responses to 
people’s queries by better understanding their interests and preferences through their 
interactions across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Earlier this year, we began testing the 
ability for Meta AI to better personalize its responses by remembering certain details from 
people’s prior queries and considering what that person engages with on our apps. We are already 
seeing this lead to deeper engagement with people we’ve rolled it out to, and it is now built into 
Meta AI across Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and our new standalone Meta AI app in the US 
and Canada. 
 
We’re also continuing to focus on helping people connect over content. In Q1, we launched a new 
experience on Instagram in the US that consists of a Feed of content your friends have left a note 
on or liked, and we’re seeing good results. We also just launched Blend, which is an opt-in 
experience in direct messages that enables you to blend your Reels algorithm with your friends to 
spark conversations over each other’s interests. These features all lean into Instagram’s position 
at the intersection of entertainment and social connection. WhatsApp remains at its core a private 
messaging app, but it has evolved to also become a place people come to get updates from 
accounts they are connected to or follow. Today, there are tens of billions of views of Status p osts 
on WhatsApp each day, and we continue to invest in the Updates tab as a place people can go to

Compare Meta’s approaches to AI coding agents versus AI recommendation systems for cross-platform product optimization.,,"Meta’s approach to AI coding agents focuses on developing systems that can match the abilities of a mid-level engineer, aiming for these agents to handle a substantial part of AI research and development by mid to late next year. The main priority is accelerating internal progress by automating and enhancing the efficiency of development tasks.

In contrast, for AI recommendation systems—such as those that power feed and ad recommendations across Meta’s platforms—the focus is on continual model innovation to optimize user experience and ad performance. Meta invests in architectural improvements (e.g., new models like GEM, Lattice, and Andromeda) to serve more relevant content and ads, driving increased conversion rates and overall business performance.

In summary: AI coding agents are being built to accelerate internal R&D through automation, while AI recommendation systems are optimized to enhance cross-platform user and advertiser outcomes through ongoing model improvements. Both are strategic investments, with coding agents aimed at internal efficiency and recommendation systems focused on external performance and revenue.","14 
 
relates to kind of core business performance and the realities of the day -to-day 
world we’re living in? 
 
Mark Zuckerberg: I can talk about the coding agent work. I don’t think that there’s been any real 
change in our prediction for the timing of this. 
 
 So I’d say it’s basically still on track for something around a mid-level engineer 
kind of starting to become possible sometime this year, scaling into next year. 
So I’d expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are going 
to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development. So we’re 
focused on that. 
 
 Internally, we’re also very focused on building AI agents or systems that can 
help run different experiments to increase recommendations across our other 
AI products like the ones that do recommendations across our feeds and things 
like that. 
 
 So I think that, if it works, should just accelerate our progress in those areas, 
that’s the basic bet that we’re making. 
 
Susan Li: On your second question about our lowered expense outlook. Really, we are 
four months into the year. The lowered outlook reflects more refined forecasts 
including updated expectations for both employee compensation as well as 
some other non-headcount-related operating expenses this year.  
 
 And that’s partially offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to 
our increased CapEx outlook as well as higher expected Reality Labs cost of 
goods sold. And we’ve maintained our $5 billion range just given the more 
dynamic operating environment that we’re in. 
 
 And what I would say is our investment posture today reflects the significant 
opportunities that we see across each of the company and priorities that we’re 
investing in this year. We will obviously continue evaluating depending on how 
macro conditions more broadly evolve. 
 
 But we really feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical for 
us to continue investing in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of our efficiency 
work over the last two years was to put us in a stronger financial position so 
that we can continue investing in key priorities through tougher financial 
cycles. 
 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please 
go ahead. 
 
Ross Sandler: Great. Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote 
presentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your teams

Susan just talked about earlier and that even some of the testing that the ad 
ranking team wants to run is just getting kind of delayed.|18 
 
videos and understand all those things and have good conversations about 
that, I think, is going to be important overall. 
 
 So yes. I mean I think Meta AI is well positioned, but we have a lot of work to do 
in order to make it the leading personal AI. 
 
Susan Li: And Youssef, on your second question, it is really too early to speak about what 
those changes could be because we are in the process of engaging with the 
European Commission. 
 
 I think maybe the most useful sort of metric I could give you is just that our 
advertising revenue in the European economic area and Switzerland, which 
would be the geographies impacted here, was 16% of our worldwide total 
revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to engage actively with the 
European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next 
quarter’s call. 
 
Kenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question. 
 
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.  
 
Mark Mahaney: Thanks, I’ll just throw in two. I think you called out that the China -based 
retailers as one sort of potentially soft advertising vertical. Anything else you’d 
call out? And I would just suggest autos. 
 
 Is that an area of any softness? And then on the Reality Labs and on the losses 
associated with Reality Labs, they’ve been very consistent $4 billion a quarter 
for quite some time. 
 
 Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a reason to think, is there a factor 
that would occur that would cause those losses to come down and when would 
that be? But maybe more importantly, what is going to cause those losses to 
come down? Thank you very much. 
 
Susan Li: Mark, let me take your first question about other verticals. We generally saw 
healthy growth in most verticals in Q1. We did see some weakness in gaming 
and politics. 
 
 So year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1 as we lapped a period 
of strong spend from China-based advertisers that were promoting a larger 
volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year-over-year growth in the 
government and politics vertical dropped sharply as expected with the 
conclusion of U.S. elections. But that continues to just be a very small vertical 
overall. And then your second question on Reality Labs. 
 
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can take the Reality Labs one. I mean we’re basically focused on doing 
the work more efficiently. But as the AI glasses have really taken off, I’ve talked 
about this on a number of calls. There are more investments that I think makes 
sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very 
quickly.|15 
 
 So I guess looking out either this year or next year or whatever, when do you 
kind of see some of this constraint being eased back? And more broadly, we’re 
kind of three years past the IDFA impact to your business. 
 
 So where do you think we are in terms of just the overall improvements to the 
ad ranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver? And like what 
inning are we in on that in your opinion? Thank you very much. 
 
Susan Li: I can take a shot at both of those and Mark, you can obviously chime in. On the 
first question, the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic, both in terms 
of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity online, but also in 
terms of the demand from different product groups in our company, whether 
they are in the gen AI teams or whether they’re doing more of the core AI work 
around ranking and recommendations. 
 
 So both the supply and demand are quite fluid. And so we don’t have a sort of 
fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough 
supply to meet all demand, but that’s something that we are working very hard 
to alleviate and it’s part of why we accelerated bringing more data center space 
online this year. And also, we’re very focused on increasing the efficiency of our 
workloads over the course of the year. On your second question about ads 
performance, ads ranking. 
 
 We have invested for many years and continue to invest in driving ad 
performance improvements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains 
strong. And in fact, we continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than 
ad impressions in Q1, so reflecting increased conversion rates, and ads ranking 
and modeling improvements are a big driver of overall performance gains.  
 
 We have a lot of innovations in model architecture in both the ads retrieval and 
ranking stages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to 
people. 
 
 We talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model 
in Q1. And we have talked about some of the prior model architecture 
improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. 
 
 For us, we really believe, first and foremost, that advertising is a relative 
performance game. That’s especially important for us because the vast 
majority of our business is direct response advertising. 
 
 So we feel good about how the prior investments are paying off and we 
continue to invest in a lot of different work to constantly improve our ads 
ranking and recommendations performance. 
 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.

Compare the impact of Reality Labs’ hardware costs vs. AI data center investments on Meta’s budget.,,"Reality Labs’ hardware costs (such as AI glasses) are a significant ongoing expense for Meta, consistently resulting in substantial quarterly losses (about $4 billion per quarter), and these losses are expected to continue as Meta invests more to rapidly scale distribution of successful hardware products. In contrast, AI data center investments are driving higher infrastructure and CapEx costs, primarily to alleviate capacity bottlenecks for both core AI work and generative AI initiatives. While both areas are major budget items, Reality Labs’ costs are a persistent drag on profitability, whereas AI data center investments are viewed as essential for enabling product innovation and supporting revenue-generating improvements in AI-driven products like ad ranking and recommendations.","14

in Q1. And we have talked about some of the prior model architecture 
improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. 
 
 For us, we really believe, first and foremost, that advertising is a relative 
performance game. That’s especially important for us because the vast 
majority of our business is direct response advertising. 
 
 So we feel good about how the prior investments are paying off and we 
continue to invest in a lot of different work to constantly improve our ads 
ranking and recommendations performance.

Assess how Meta’s AI capacity relief strategies also affect Q1 ad ranking and modeling improvements.,,"Meta’s efforts to relieve AI capacity constraints—such as accelerating data center buildout and increasing workload efficiency—have a direct positive impact on Q1 ad ranking and modeling improvements. As Susan Li explained, alleviating AI bottlenecks allows more experiments and advancements in areas like ad ranking and recommendations. This increased capacity underpins innovations such as the introduction of the GEM ads recommendation model in Q1, driving stronger conversion growth and improved ad performance. In summary, Meta’s strategies to expand AI capacity are directly enabling greater innovation and effectiveness in ad modeling and ranking.","14

Mark Zuckerberg: I can talk about the coding agent work. I don’t think that there’s been any real 
change in our prediction for the timing of this. 
 
 So I’d say it’s basically still on track for something around a mid-level engineer 
kind of starting to become possible sometime this year, scaling into next year. 
So I’d expect that by the middle to end of next year, AI coding agents are going 
to be doing a substantial part of AI research and development. So we’re 
focused on that. 
 
 Internally, we’re also very focused on building AI agents or systems that can 
help run different experiments to increase recommendations across our other 
AI products like the ones that do recommendations across our feeds and things 
like that. 
 
 So I think that, if it works, should just accelerate our progress in those areas, 
that’s the basic bet that we’re making. 
 
Susan Li: On your second question about our lowered expense outlook. Really, we are 
four months into the year. The lowered outlook reflects more refined forecasts 
including updated expectations for both employee compensation as well as 
some other non-headcount-related operating expenses this year.  
 
 And that’s partially offset by higher expected infrastructure costs related to 
our increased CapEx outlook as well as higher expected Reality Labs cost of 
goods sold. And we’ve maintained our $5 billion range just given the more 
dynamic operating environment that we’re in. 
 
 And what I would say is our investment posture today reflects the significant 
opportunities that we see across each of the company and priorities that we’re 
investing in this year. We will obviously continue evaluating depending on how 
macro conditions more broadly evolve. 
 
 But we really feel like these are big strategic priorities for us and are critical for 
us to continue investing in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of our efficiency 
work over the last two years was to put us in a stronger financial position so 
that we can continue investing in key priorities through tougher financial 
cycles. 
 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please 
go ahead. 
 
Ross Sandler: Great. Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote 
presentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your teams 
want to or aspire to do are kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity, which 
Susan just talked about earlier and that even some of the testing that the ad 
ranking team wants to run is just getting kind of delayed.|18 
 
videos and understand all those things and have good conversations about 
that, I think, is going to be important overall. 
 
 So yes. I mean I think Meta AI is well positioned, but we have a lot of work to do 
in order to make it the leading personal AI. 
 
Susan Li: And Youssef, on your second question, it is really too early to speak about what 
those changes could be because we are in the process of engaging with the 
European Commission. 
 
 I think maybe the most useful sort of metric I could give you is just that our 
advertising revenue in the European economic area and Switzerland, which 
would be the geographies impacted here, was 16% of our worldwide total 
revenue in 2024. Again, we are continuing to engage actively with the 
European Commission further on this, so we hope to have more clarity by next 
quarter’s call. 
 
Kenneth Dorell: Krista, we have time for one last question. 
 
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.  
 
Mark Mahaney: Thanks, I’ll just throw in two. I think you called out that the China -based 
retailers as one sort of potentially soft advertising vertical. Anything else you’d 
call out? And I would just suggest autos. 
 
 Is that an area of any softness? And then on the Reality Labs and on the losses 
associated with Reality Labs, they’ve been very consistent $4 billion a quarter 
for quite some time. 
 
 Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Is there a reason to think, is there a factor 
that would occur that would cause those losses to come down and when would 
that be? But maybe more importantly, what is going to cause those losses to 
come down? Thank you very much. 
 
Susan Li: Mark, let me take your first question about other verticals. We generally saw 
healthy growth in most verticals in Q1. We did see some weakness in gaming 
and politics. 
 
 So year-over-year growth in gaming was negative in Q1 as we lapped a period 
of strong spend from China-based advertisers that were promoting a larger 
volume of game titles in Q1 of 2024. And then year-over-year growth in the 
government and politics vertical dropped sharply as expected with the 
conclusion of U.S. elections. But that continues to just be a very small vertical 
overall. And then your second question on Reality Labs. 
 
Mark Zuckerberg: Yes. I can take the Reality Labs one. I mean we’re basically focused on doing 
the work more efficiently. But as the AI glasses have really taken off, I’ve talked 
about this on a number of calls. There are more investments that I think makes 
sense to make around making sure that we can distribute this and grow it very 
quickly.|15 
 
 So I guess looking out either this year or next year or whatever, when do you 
kind of see some of this constraint being eased back? And more broadly, we’re 
kind of three years past the IDFA impact to your business. 
 
 So where do you think we are in terms of just the overall improvements to the 
ad ranking system, the ROI that you guys are able to deliver? And like what 
inning are we in on that in your opinion? Thank you very much. 
 
Susan Li: I can take a shot at both of those and Mark, you can obviously chime in. On the 
first question, the capacity landscape we are in is pretty dynamic, both in terms 
of the many moving parts in terms of us bringing capacity online, but also in 
terms of the demand from different product groups in our company, whether 
they are in the gen AI teams or whether they’re doing more of the core AI work 
around ranking and recommendations. 
 
 So both the supply and demand are quite fluid. And so we don’t have a sort of 
fixed answer in terms of when we expect that we will sort of have enough 
supply to meet all demand, but that’s something that we are working very hard 
to alleviate and it’s part of why we accelerated bringing more data center space 
online this year. And also, we’re very focused on increasing the efficiency of our 
workloads over the course of the year. On your second question about ads 
performance, ads ranking. 
 
 We have invested for many years and continue to invest in driving ad 
performance improvements. Year-over-year conversion growth remains 
strong. And in fact, we continue to see conversions grow at a faster rate than 
ad impressions in Q1, so reflecting increased conversion rates, and ads ranking 
and modeling improvements are a big driver of overall performance gains.  
 
 We have a lot of innovations in model architecture in both the ads retrieval and 
ranking stages of the ads delivery process to serve more relevant ads to 
people. 
 
 We talked about the introduction of the new GEM ads recommendation model 
in Q1. And we have talked about some of the prior model architecture 
improvements like Lattice and Andromeda in past quarters. 
 
 For us, we really believe, first and foremost, that advertising is a relative 
performance game. That’s especially important for us because the vast 
majority of our business is direct response advertising. 
 
 So we feel good about how the prior investments are paying off and we 
continue to invest in a lot of different work to constantly improve our ads 
ranking and recommendations performance.

How do fluid compute constraints and capacity needs delay ads ranking and cross-domain AI experimentation?,,"Compute constraints and dynamic capacity needs are delaying ads ranking improvements and cross-domain AI experimentation because there isn’t enough compute available to meet all internal demands. As stated, many projects—including ads ranking team tests—are bottlenecked by limited AI capacity. This means some desired experiments and model improvements are getting delayed, as compute resources must be allocated carefully across both generative AI and core AI work. The company is accelerating new data center space and working to increase workload efficiency, but until more capacity comes online, these constraints will continue to impact the pace of innovation and experimentation.","15

Justin Post: Great, thank you. A couple of questions. Just on the guide in the second 
quarter, there are reports of potential supply issues in eCommerce, how you 
thought about that in the guide and maybe how you’re thinking about it for the 
back half. And then on a bigger picture question.  
 
 Your CapEx spend is now close to some hyperscalers with very big client bases. 
Just help us conceptualize the kind of ecosystem you’re building with your 
CapEx. I know you gave a lot of help on the intro, but maybe the ROI works 
without direct enterprise spend to drive revenues. How you’re thinking about 
that? Thank you. 
 
Susan Li: Thanks, Justin. On the Q2 guide, there’s uncertainty, obviously in how the 
macro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different 
segments of our business. 
 
 Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in. And partly -- that’s partly why 
the $3 billion range reflects the potential for a wider range of outcomes.  
 
 Specifically, we have seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-
commerce exporters, which we believe is in anticipation of the de minimis 
exemption going away on May 2nd. A portion of that spend has been 
redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below 
the levels prior to April. 
 
 But our Q2 outlook reflects the trends we’re seeing so far in April, which have 
generally been healthy. So it’s very early. Hard to know how things will play out 
over the quarter and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year.  
 
 Your second question is about why we’re investing more in CapEx. And we 
really believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives us a 
meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and 
services over the coming years. And there are a lot of opportunities also for us 
to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads and 
recommendation work. 
 
 So even with the capacity that we’re bringing online in 2025, we are having a 
hard time meeting the demand that teams have for compute resources across 
the company. 
 
 So we are going to continually invest meaningfully here across our 
infrastructure footprint, but we are also really looking to build this capacity in a 
way that gives us the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over 
the coming years, so we can respond to how the market and technology 
develop. 
 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan.

Contrast strategies for expanding data center capacity vs. managing compute demand across product groups.,,"Expanding data center capacity involves accelerating the build-out and bringing more data center space online, as highlighted by Susan Li, to increase the overall supply of compute resources. This approach provides flexibility for future growth and aims to meet the growing infrastructure needs driven by both core AI work and newer areas like gen AI teams.

In contrast, managing compute demand across product groups focuses on improving the efficiency of existing workloads and prioritizing allocation of resources. Since both supply and demand are fluid, the company is also investing in increasing workload efficiency and carefully balancing competing demands from various product groups.

In summary, expanding capacity addresses the need for more supply in the longer term, while managing demand involves optimizing how existing resources are used in the short term. Both strategies are being pursued in parallel to alleviate current constraints and ensure future flexibility.","15

us to continue investing in. And in fact, I think one of the aims of our efficiency 
work over the last two years was to put us in a stronger financial position so 
that we can continue investing in key priorities through tougher financial 
cycles. 
 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please 
go ahead. 
 
Ross Sandler: Great. Mark, yesterday in one of your many kind of podcast or keynote 
presentations, you had mentioned that like a bunch of projects that your teams 
want to or aspire to do are kind of bottlenecked by the AI capacity, which 
Susan just talked about earlier and that even some of the testing that the ad 
ranking team wants to run is just getting kind of delayed.|12 
 
Justin Post: Great, thank you. A couple of questions. Just on the guide in the second 
quarter, there are reports of potential supply issues in eCommerce, how you 
thought about that in the guide and maybe how you’re thinking about it for the 
back half. And then on a bigger picture question.  
 
 Your CapEx spend is now close to some hyperscalers with very big client bases. 
Just help us conceptualize the kind of ecosystem you’re building with your 
CapEx. I know you gave a lot of help on the intro, but maybe the ROI works 
without direct enterprise spend to drive revenues. How you’re thinking about 
that? Thank you. 
 
Susan Li: Thanks, Justin. On the Q2 guide, there’s uncertainty, obviously in how the 
macro environment will evolve over time and how that could impact different 
segments of our business. 
 
 Our Q2 revenue outlook aims to factor that in. And partly -- that’s partly why 
the $3 billion range reflects the potential for a wider range of outcomes.  
 
 Specifically, we have seen some reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-
commerce exporters, which we believe is in anticipation of the de minimis 
exemption going away on May 2nd. A portion of that spend has been 
redirected to other markets, but overall spend for those advertisers is below 
the levels prior to April. 
 
 But our Q2 outlook reflects the trends we’re seeing so far in April, which have 
generally been healthy. So it’s very early. Hard to know how things will play out 
over the quarter and certainly harder to know that for the rest of the year.  
 
 Your second question is about why we’re investing more in CapEx. And we 
really believe that our ability to build world-class infrastructure gives us a 
meaningful advantage in both developing the leading AI technology and 
services over the coming years. And there are a lot of opportunities also for us 
to improve our core business by putting more compute against our ads and 
recommendation work. 
 
 So even with the capacity that we’re bringing online in 2025, we are having a 
hard time meeting the demand that teams have for compute resources across 
the company. 
 
 So we are going to continually invest meaningfully here across our 
infrastructure footprint, but we are also really looking to build this capacity in a 
way that gives us the maximum flexibility in how and when we deploy it over 
the coming years, so we can respond to how the market and technology 
develop. 
 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. 
Please go ahead. 
 
Douglas Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on CapEx and 
infrastructure spending. Just on the higher range for CapEx.",./dataset_2/earningscall\META-Q1-2025-Earnings-Call-Transcript-1.pdf
How will a 30% SKU cut and focus on breakthrough beverage innovation support SBUX's premium positioning?,,"A 30% reduction in beverage and food SKUs will help Starbucks simplify its menu, which positions partners for success, improves consistency, and enhances customer satisfaction—all of which are key to strengthening its premium positioning. By focusing on breakthrough beverage and food innovation with fewer, better offerings, Starbucks can ensure each product better reflects its premium brand and is in line with customer trends and preferences.

Our work to reintroduce our brand is just beginning, but our core business is already strengthening, demonstrating
that when we talk about our business, customers respond. Through the quarter, we saw a shift in our sales mix
towards coffee and Espresso-based beverages, which over-delivered and compensated for lower-than-expected
performance across our holiday promotions. We've been focused on simplifying our menu to position partners for
success, improve consistency, drive customer satisfaction, and enhance our economics. As part of this work, we
made some late simplifications to our holiday product lineup and believe we have more opportunity ahead as we
follow a disciplined stage gate process to innovate and bring to market fewer, better beverage and food offerings that
reflect our premium positioning.
In the coming months, you'll see us begin to optimize our menu offerings, resulting in roughly 30% reduction in both
beverages and food SKUs by the end of fiscal year 2025. As we do, we'll work to lead this market with breakthrough
beverage and food innovation. We'll do this by being responsive to customer trends and their changing preferences.
We'll rely on our highly-engaged green apron partners for inspiration like we did with our Lavender lineup last year
and we'll be more responsive and tuned in to cultural moments like we did with the Dubai matcha.
We also saw continued improvement in comp trends driven by ""Back to Starbucks"" efforts launched during Q1. Non-
Starbucks Rewards customer traffic grew quarter-over-quarter. Starbucks Rewards membership and spend grew
both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And price parity for non-dairy milk customizations brought back lapsed
Starbucks Rewards members.
Our US category share among QSRs also recovered in Q1 following two quarters of decline. These things tell us our
actions are resonating with customers. Progress like this shows me that the Starbucks brand is still resilient and
strong and that we have significant future potential. More importantly, it shows that we can sell more of our core
beverages simply by demonstrating our premium value.|4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha

Over the past four months, we've been focused on getting Back to Starbucks and those things that have always set
us apart, a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our
skilled baristas. We believe it's the fundamental change in strategy we need to solve our underlying issues, restore
confidence in our brand and return the business to sustainable long-term growth. While we're only one quarter into
our turnaround, we're moving quickly to act on the ""Back to Starbucks"" efforts we outlined on our last call. And to
date, we've seen a positive response.
As Rachel will outline in greater detail, our financial performance met our expectations for the quarter, with a total
company revenue of $9.4 billion, a global comparable store sales decline of 4%, a global operating margin of 11.9%,
and overall earnings per share of $0.69. To be clear, these results have room for improvement, but I'm confident the
disciplined investments we're making in labor, marketing, technology, and stores this fiscal year will help stabilize the
business and position Starbucks for future growth. We're also working to change the role, structure and size of our
support teams to improve efficiency and accountability. This will ensure we deliver on our commitments and our work
to get Back to Starbucks.
Let me share with you some of the progress we've made through the quarter and what we're focusing on next. Our
path ""Back to Starbucks"" in the US is driven by four core initiatives: reintroduce Starbucks to the world, deliver the
customer experience to win the morning, reestablish Starbucks as the community coffeehouse, and ensure Starbucks
is the unrivaled best job in retail, recognizing our success starts and ends with our green apron partners.
During the quarter, we moved quickly to refocus the business, our mission and our marketing to align with our core
identity as the premier purveyor of the finest coffee in the world. We started by reducing the frequency of discount-
driven offers, resulting in 40% fewer discounted transactions year-over-year. We also removed the extra charge for
non-dairy milk, customizations and identified several other steps we can take to make our pricing architecture more
transparent for customers. And just this week, we launched a new Coffee Forward US marketing campaign,
reintroducing the brand to a broader customer audience.|4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha

If you take one thing from today's call, let it be this; despite near-term challenges, we have significant strengths and a
clear plan. The response we've seen since fundamentally shifting our strategy to get back to Starbucks gives us
confidence we're on the track to turn the business around. We are where we want to be one quarter in, but much of
our work is just beginning. As we continue to learn and implement our ""Back to Starbucks"" plan, I believe we'll make it
easier to be a customer and, in turn, I believe they'll visit more often. We'll also find more ways to set our partners up
for success, so they're able to deliver a great customer experience every time. In doing so, we'll reinvigorate our
brand, drive stronger financial returns and return Starbucks to growth. There is important work ahead and I look
forward to bringing you along.
With that, I'll turn it over to Rachel.

Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone.
As Brian shared, we're pleased with our start to fiscal year 2025 with our Q1 performance meeting our expectations.
Our ""Back to Starbucks"" strategy has already driven early progress, including gradual top-line improvement, giving us
confidence that we're focused on the right priorities.
Our Q1 consolidated revenue was $9.4 billion, flat to the prior year, reflecting 7% net new company-operated store
growth over the past 12 months, offset by a 4% decline in comparable store sales.
Our global comparable store sales decline was primarily due to a 4% decline in the US. US comparable store sales
improved sequentially throughout the quarter, most evident in the morning daypart as non-Starbucks Rewards
customers grew from our strategic shift to broader marketing.",./dataset_2/earningscall\starbucks_earnings_call.pdf

The Coffee Forward marketing campaign, combined with fewer discount-driven offers, reintroduced the brand to a wider audience, helping to increase non-Starbucks Rewards customer traffic quarter-over-quarter.

How is SBUX nearly doubling mktg spend from discounts to enhance in-store barista-customer connections and drive brand experience?,,"Starbucks is nearly doubling its marketing spend by reallocating funds previously used for discounting into ""working dollars"" that directly enhance the brand and in-store experience. Instead of focusing on discounts, the increased marketing budget promotes the craft and quality of Starbucks coffee, highlights barista-customer connections (e.g., new ads featuring baristas writing on cups), and supports initiatives like the ""Back to Starbucks"" rollout. This shift aims to improve both brand commitment and the customer experience in stores, energizing both partners and customers, while remaining neutral to overall business costs.","4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752750-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript 14/35
And so, I think it's a combination of shifting the approach as far as reaching both rewards and non-rewards customers
with, I think a compelling message around the craft and the quality of our coffee and our experience. And then also, I
think our partners in the stores are really embracing getting back to Starbucks and enjoying making the espresso
drinks and providing people that craft experience. And as you've seen even most recently, the new ""Back to
Starbucks"" rollout that we've got in progress and I was in some stores even this morning, and the energy is really
exciting to see both from our partners and our customers. Our customers are feeling the enhanced experience
coming from our partners.
So, definitely baby steps in both of these areas, but all moving in the right direction.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with TD Cowen. Please state your question.
Andrew Charles
Great. Thanks. Brian, can you talk a little bit more about Tressie Lieberman's plan of attack to help build on the initial
marketing work around reintroducing the brand? And curious, last year, it was disclosed about $600 million of
advertising spend. What level can we think about for 2025, if you can comment on that as well?
Brian Niccol
Yeah. Look, what we're definitely doing right now is switching the dollars out of discounting into what I would call
working dollars for the brands and the brand experience. And so, what you're going to continue to see is, you might
have saw we just broke a new ad over the weekend, highlighting, I think a key point of difference for Starbucks, which
is centered on this connection that our baristas and our green apron partners have with our customers. And one of
the ways that comes through is writing on cups.|4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752750-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript 15/35
And so, what I love about this is, look, we're taking these dollars, allocating it to talk about the brand experience, and
it's in such a way where it's very executable for people to actually experience it through our partners in the stores.
And so, you're going to continue to see us use these dollars to turn it into working dollars to drive towards a brand
commitment, but then also an experience commitment where hopefully every time you come into a Starbucks, not
only do you get your coffee or your drink, but you also get this connection. And that's what we're going to continue to
do. I think we're still finalizing exactly what does that spend look like ongoing, but I like the transition that we've made
and I'm optimistic about the campaign that we've just started because there's a lot of additional elements still to come.
Rachel Ruggeri
The way to think about it too from a marketing as a percentage of revenue, we are increasing it. You could say close
to doubling it, but we've reduced the discount. So, we've increased overall net revenue while we're putting it towards,
as Brian said, the working dollars in marketing. So, it's neutral to the business overall, but you will see a shift in terms
of how it shows up in the P&L and in the business.
Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from Danilo Gargiulo with Bernstein. Please state your question.
Danilo Gargiulo
Hi, thanks for the question. Brian, I was wondering if you can help us quantify the impact of the operational
improvements that you're starting to see at Starbucks. Maybe specifically, if you can help us understand maybe what
percentage of the stores are operating in line with the four-minute handover timeline that you are expecting from the
stores? And what kind of comp differential do you see between the stores that are operating at the level of efficiency
that you are expecting versus the ones that need some incremental time to transform? Thank you.

Brian Niccol
Yeah. Look, you're right. It's a new learning that we picked up over the last couple of months, specifically as we've
gotten very focused on getting the four-minute solution and bringing order to mobile ordering. And what has become
clear is it's not -- in most stores, it is not driven by a lack of capacity. It's more the process combined with the
algorithm to sequence the mobile orders with the cafe.
So, there is a threshold where the volume gets to a place where the additional equipment is necessary, but that's only
happening in like the top quartile of stores. And in the majority of our stores, just kind of putting the right process, the
right deployment, combined with the algorithm, we see a big unlock in transaction throughput capability.
So, that's what we're focused on. And it's a learning we've picked up over the last couple of months. And I think this is
what's great about taking the test-and-learn approach is as we learn, we adopt and what we're adopting towards is
making sure that we get the best experience for both the partner and our customer.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Christine Cho with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
Christine Cho
Thank you. So, Brian, as you come into the coffee business with fresh pair of eyes, I was hoping to get your
assessment on the challenges of drawing younger customers back into the stores. Do you still view this as an
important strategic focus in your turnaround plans in North America? And if so, why do you think they're more
hesitant? Is it premium prices? Is it that they're drinking less coffee in general? Are they attracted to more local
coffeehouses? And more importantly, how do these observations inform your menu and marketing strategy going
forward? Thank you.",./dataset_2/earningscall\starbucks_earnings_call.pdf
"How do process, algorithm, and selective equipment upgrades improve Starbucks' four-minute handover efficiency, revenue, and brand experience?",,"Implementing better processes and algorithms allows Starbucks to more effectively sequence mobile and cafe orders, significantly improving transaction throughput and helping more stores achieve the four-minute handover target.

Brian Niccol
Yeah. Look, what we're definitely doing right now is switching the dollars out of discounting into what I would call
working dollars for the brands and the brand experience. And so, what you're going to continue to see is, you might
have saw we just broke a new ad over the weekend, highlighting, I think a key point of difference for Starbucks, which
is centered on this connection that our baristas and our green apron partners have with our customers. And one of

only do you get your coffee or your drink, but you also get this connection. And that's what we're going to continue to
do. I think we're still finalizing exactly what does that spend look like ongoing, but I like the transition that we've made
and I'm optimistic about the campaign that we've just started because there's a lot of additional elements still to come.

The way to think about it too from a marketing as a percentage of revenue, we are increasing it. You could say close
to doubling it, but we've reduced the discount. So, we've increased overall net revenue while we're putting it towards,
as Brian said, the working dollars in marketing. So, it's neutral to the business overall, but you will see a shift in terms
of how it shows up in the P&L and in the business.

Brian Niccol
Yeah. Look, you're right. It's a new learning that we picked up over the last couple of months, specifically as we've
gotten very focused on getting the four-minute solution and bringing order to mobile ordering. And what has become
clear is it's not -- in most stores, it is not driven by a lack of capacity. It's more the process combined with the
algorithm to sequence the mobile orders with the cafe.
So, there is a threshold where the volume gets to a place where the additional equipment is necessary, but that's only
happening in like the top quartile of stores. And in the majority of our stores, just kind of putting the right process, the
right deployment, combined with the algorithm, we see a big unlock in transaction throughput capability.
So, that's what we're focused on. And it's a learning we've picked up over the last couple of months. And I think this is
what's great about taking the test-and-learn approach is as we learn, we adopt and what we're adopting towards is
making sure that we get the best experience for both the partner and our customer.

"How does Starbucks’ new prioritization algorithm affect mobile order congestion versus promise time, time slots, and siren tech?",,"Starbucks’ new prioritization algorithm directly targets mobile order congestion by properly sequencing orders, which helps prevent production bottlenecks that occur when too many mobile orders are processed simultaneously. This improves both partner (employee) and customer satisfaction and allows baristas to maintain a “moment of connection” even during peak times.

Compared to promise time adjustments and the introduction of time slots (which are still being tested and could allow customers to schedule when to pick up orders), the algorithm focuses on smoothing the workflow behind the counter, enabling a more consistent four-minute throughput goal. Siren technology and equipment are being deployed only in the highest-transaction stores, as order sequencing (not capacity or equipment) has been identified as the main bottleneck.

In summary, the prioritization algorithm directly addresses order flow and congestion, while time slots and promise times may further optimize the customer experience in future tests, and siren tech supports throughput mainly where volume is highest. Early pilots of the algorithm show improvements in speed, partner satisfaction, and customer satisfaction.","4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha

Yeah. So, what we've done so far is we've definitely put the stores into kind of quartiles as it relates to how many
transactions they're working through. And what we've -- through this work, what we've discovered is more of the
challenge comes through, frankly, the mobile ordering system not having a sequencing system. And what happens is,
that counter area gets really crowded, congested, and what occurs for our partners is the work switches to the task of
just trying to get drinks and food solved for the rush as opposed to being able to consistently deliver the moment of
connection while they still deliver the coffee drinks.
And so, the good news is we have a high percentage of stores that are already comping positively, because -- and
when we look at those stores, we see that the connection and the craft is being executed and we're not in as many of
these bottleneck situations. And so, that's what we're focused on is how do we eliminate these bottleneck situations
where the mobile ordering really overwhelms kind of the production experience to the point where we can no longer
provide a great service experience.
So, we've seen the difference in performance. We've seen the difference in -- and that's from a comp and financial
performance. And we've also seen the difference in partner satisfaction, customer satisfaction. So, we're working
through exactly how we measure these things because unfortunately, currently, we don't have a great system in place
to measure the timeframe on these things, which we are putting into place.
But as I mentioned earlier, the good news is, I was in one of our stores this morning where we've already started to
put this algorithm in that happens kind of behind the scenes and it smooths out, I would say, those rushes of mobile
orders such that our teams are able to provide great moments of connection for the in-cafe customer and the mobile
order customer as well as our drive-thru customer.
So -- and we're still -- we're only two weeks in on this, by the way, and it's only in three stores, but we're seeing really
good performance both in the financial performance, partner satisfaction, and customer satisfaction.

A key part of the premium value we provide is quickly and consistently delivering a high-quality handcrafted beverage
to customers. The handoff from our barista to the customer is our brand moment of truth, and we've been working
hard to get that moment right. Through the quarter, we've continued to test and learn as we position the business to
achieve our four-minute throughput goal with a moment of connection. It's become clear through our pilot work that
order sequencing creates more of a bottleneck than capacity. In short, investments in staffing and deployment,
processes and algorithm technology demonstrate the greatest opportunity to deliver a four-minute wait time in most of
our cafes. As a result, we've started to segment stores by transaction volume and are now targeting installation of
siren equipment only in our highest-quartile stores where it is needed to meet our throughput expectations.
We've also invested additional coverage hours across more than 3,000 US company-operated stores through
precision scheduling, introduced new brewed coffee and tea routines and simplified beverage builds. And soon, we'll
launch a pilot across 700 stores, looking at staffing levels to improve our green apron partners' ability to serve the
world's finest coffee with a moment of connection. We'll use learnings from this to inform the future investments we
need to make in store coverage hours to deliver both an exceptional partner and customer experience and further
differentiate our brand.
Looking forward, we're beginning to pilot a new in-store prioritization algorithm and are exploring other technology
investments to improve order sequencing and our efficiency behind the counter. We're also progressing efforts that
build on the strength and popularity of the Starbucks app. This includes development of a capacity-based time slot
model that allows customers to schedule mobile orders and a midyear update that will simplify customization options,
improve upfront pricing, and provide real-time price changes as customers customize beverages. Lastly, we're
planning to fully deploy digital menu boards in cafes across our US company-owned stores over the next 18 months
to make our offerings more easily understood and to better show customization add-ons.|4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha

And what I'm seeing in the kind of the early days of this small pilot is just that where two things are happening. One,
the partners are set up to deliver these craft drinks with a great kind of human touch or connection at the speed that
makes our customers feel really great about getting their drink or their total order.
So, they're kind of working in tandem because what the algorithm does is it takes the stress out of the system of
having -- the partner have to figure out how to solve these mobile orders that just came in that weren't sequenced.
Now what it does is it sequences those mobile orders so that it can allow the cafe order to get fulfilled in a timely
fashion and with a touch of humanity. And then, the same thing happens with the mobile order, because now we're
better sequenced up when people come in to give them their drink.
So, we're going to continue to expand the pilot. There's some other things we want to test around this with also
adding the idea of time slots, how that compares to just changing promise times. So, ideally, over the next couple of
months, we're going to get a lot of learning, which then will give us clarity on the right timetable to roll out, but don't
have definitive timing just yet.

build on the strength and popularity of the Starbucks app. This includes development of a capacity-based time slot
model that allows customers to schedule mobile orders and a midyear update that will simplify customization options,
improve upfront pricing, and provide real-time price changes as customers customize beverages. Lastly, we're
planning to fully deploy digital menu boards in cafes across our US company-owned stores over the next 18 months
to make our offerings more easily understood and to better show customization add-ons.|4/11/25, 9:19 PM Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript _ Seeking Alpha
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752750-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript 20/35
And what I'm seeing in the kind of the early days of this small pilot is just that where two things are happening. One,
the partners are set up to deliver these craft drinks with a great kind of human touch or connection at the speed that
makes our customers feel really great about getting their drink or their total order.
So, they're kind of working in tandem because what the algorithm does is it takes the stress out of the system of
having -- the partner have to figure out how to solve these mobile orders that just came in that weren't sequenced.
Now what it does is it sequences those mobile orders so that it can allow the cafe order to get fulfilled in a timely
fashion and with a touch of humanity. And then, the same thing happens with the mobile order, because now we're
better sequenced up when people come in to give them their drink.
So, we're going to continue to expand the pilot. There's some other things we want to test around this with also
adding the idea of time slots, how that compares to just changing promise times. So, ideally, over the next couple of
months, we're going to get a lot of learning, which then will give us clarity on the right timetable to roll out, but don't
have definitive timing just yet.

"Which infrequent 2024 CFO priorities involve AI governance, ESG, and third-party risk amid audit focus?",,"In 2024, infrequent CFO priorities related to audit committee focus include artificial intelligence (AI) governance (22%), environmental, social, governance (ESG) initiatives (15%), and third-party risk (10%), indicating these are less commonly top priorities compared to areas like cybersecurity and enterprise risk management.","In this quarter’s survey CFOs dialed down their 12-month outlook for economic conditions in most regions tracked by CFO Signals
compared to 3Q23. They also indicated lower year-over-year (YOY) growth expectations for earnings, revenue, and other key metrics. 
Little wonder their 2024 priorities are financial performance, growth—both organic and inorganic—and cost management.

"How are CFOs’ reduced earnings/revenue projections linked to inflation, labor market, and weaker demand?",,"CFOs’ reduced earnings and revenue projections are closely linked to concerns over inflation, interest rates, and liquidity, which 84 respondents cited as key constraints. Additionally, labor markets/talent and a slowdown in market/consumer demand were also identified as major challenges. Higher inflation and interest rates increase costs and reduce purchasing power, while a tight labor market can drive up wages. Weaker demand further dampens revenue growth, prompting CFOs to lower their outlooks for key financial metrics.","In this quarter’s survey CFOs dialed down their 12-month outlook for economic conditions in most regions tracked by CFO Signals

"Analyze the connection between capital (re)allocation, M&A-driven growth forecasts, and planned deal volume changes.",,"Capital (re)allocation and M&A-driven growth are closely connected in CFOs' 2024 plans. According to the context, 67% of CFOs plan to allocate or reallocate capital to new business investments over the next 12 months, indicating a strong emphasis on fueling expansion and transformation. In line with this, 34% expect the average number of deals their companies close to increase, showing M&A activity is set to rise. Furthermore, M&A is expected to contribute significantly to growth, with 51% anticipating between 1% and 10% of company growth from M&A over the next three years, and 28% expecting 11% to 50%. This suggests that targeted capital (re)allocation is directly supporting a more robust pipeline of deals, underlining CFOs’ intent to pursue M&A as a critical lever for future growth.","7%

"How do net interest margin shifts, risk costs, non-interest income, and lacking scale economies impact global bank valuations?",,"Net interest margin improvements have been the main driver of higher returns on tangible equity (ROTE) for banks in recent years. However, risk costs and limited growth in non-interest income have constrained further gains. Additionally, many banks lack absolute scale economies—tech investment and size have not significantly reduced costs industry-wide—so cost efficiencies are hard to achieve. As a result, over half of banks in many markets trade at a price-to-book ratio below 1, signaling valuation challenges driven by these factors.","Exhibit 6

Global Banking Annual Review 2024: Attaining escape velocity|markets (for example, the United States) is 
declining (Exhibit 9).1 AI could change that, but at 
most banks, generative AI (gen AI) is currently  
in pilot mode. And with it comes more spending 
and more regulatory requirements, so many 
banks have adopted a cautious posture. Some of 
the winners are moving from this pilot approach 
to a domain approach, where they are looking to 
streamline domains end to end and applying  
all levers, including AI and gen AI. We will see 
when those effects show up in the data. Banking 
in many global markets also doesn’t exhibit 
absolute scale economies, though we do see 
scale effects in specific subsectors, like 
retirement record keeping and some parts of 
capital markets (see sidebar, “Does scale  
still matter?”). As a result, neither tech spending

cost curve for banks to squeeze out some extra 
points of margin. 
 — Improvement in margins may not be able  
to come from more cost cutting. To maintain 
current ROTE in the face of some macro- 
driven scenarios, the industry would need to 
reduce its cost per asset by 5 percent per 
annum, or five times the industry’s historic 
performance of 1 percent reduction per  
annum (Exhibit 10).

Assess how net interest margin gains and non-interest income shifts influenced 2021–23 ROTE changes.,,"From 2021 to 2023, improvement in net interest margin was the primary driver of increased return on tangible equity (ROTE) in the global banking sector. The increase in net interest income accounted for a significant ROTE boost (index rising from 100 to 107.3 with rate increases). In contrast, non-interest income declined (from 100 to 91.7), putting downward pressure on ROTE. Overall, net interest margin gains outweighed the negative impact from lower non-interest income, leading to higher ROTE over the period.","Exhibit 6

"Compare 2023 net incomes for banking, tech/media/telecom, and conglomerates; calculate banking’s lead over each.",,"In 2023, the global banking industry generated $1,151 billion in net income, compared to $597 billion for technology, media, and telecom, and $141 billion for conglomerates. Banking’s lead is $554 billion over tech/media/telecom and $1,010 billion over conglomerates.","The path is more common now 
In good news, higher performance is becoming 
more distributed across the industry (perhaps aided 
by the regulated nature of different markets). Today, 
14 percent of banks account for 80 percent of the 
economic profit in the industry, up from 11 percent in 
2013 (Exhibit 13). The figure is almost five times the 
average of all other industries, where performance 
is far more concentrated in a few players (Exhibit 14).
The outperformance can be large 
Our analysis of TSR outperformers (in the United 
States) shows that there’s a wide dispersion in 
performance: 14 points between the top and bottom 
deciles across 90 top US banks between 2013 and 
2023. Four operational metrics, along with avoiding 
risk, largely explain most of the outperformance of 
TSR: revenue growth (34 percent); better net interest 
margin management (34 percent) from lower cost; 
stickier deposit-gathering strategies (lowering the 
cost of funding) or better distribution and credit  
risk management into more lucrative lending 
activity, in both cases improving NIMs; growing fee 
income (16 percent) from expansion in advisory 
services, wealth management, and other fee-heavy 
businesses; and cost efficiency (5 percent), which 
while significant, has only a minimal explanatory 
effect on TSR (perhaps because costs are often in 
the bank’s control and many do manage down costs 
rapidly, so TSR becomes less differentiating). 
Many other metrics don’t contribute materially to 
TSR (for example, asset size at the institutional level, 
once again emphasizing institutional scale doesn’t 
matter as much). Calculating these kinds of metrics 
for your bank can help determine whether your  
bank is truly investing behind them. For example,  
do the projects in the tech portfolio support

"How do segment focus, local scale benefits, and margin strategies drive uneven value creation globally?",,"Segment focus, local scale benefits, and margin strategies drive uneven global value creation by enabling banks to outperform through targeted approaches:

- Segment focus: Winning banks commit to the right growth segments (e.g., wealth, payments, mass affluent) without over-concentrating risk, resulting in revenue growth 1.5x local GDP and higher profit pools.
- Local scale benefits: Banks that identify and exploit pockets of economies of scale (such as marketing, wealth brokerage, or standardized servicing) can boost margins by reducing expense ratios, even if scale isn’t attainable industry-wide.
- Margin strategies: Outperformers reallocate resources toward higher ROE sectors and fee income, and optimize costs with efficiency ratios below 50% and lower risk costs than peers.

Combined, these strategies explain why value creation and top performance are concentrated in a minority of banks globally: only 14% have both high price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios, with significant regional variation.","Exhibit 15

ratios, thereby lowering the institutions’ overall 
expenses. Other winners have leveraged their 
existing platforms in sectors that carry higher 
ROEs, like wealth and payments; a notable 
example is the mass affluent segment that, in 
many countries, composes the largest profit 
pool of wealth. Others have doubled down in 
capital markets to drive ROE-enhancing fee 
income growth. For most, these changes have 
been a handful of points of tilt in direction,

 — Finding scale where it matters to drive 
productivity and acquisition. While in some 
countries, finding economies of scale is elusive 
at the overall industry level, scale does exist  
in pockets, and finding out how to harness it can 
thus have a significant effect. Some winners 
have found those pockets and doubled down on 
their position to create more margin by moving 
up the scale curve. Examples include finding 
economies of scale in marketing spending; in 
segments like retirement and wealth brokerage; 
and in parts of custody operations or customer 
servicing that are more standardized and where 
economies of scale therefore exist. Additionally, 
scale can be local, regional, national, or global, 
and the best banks maximize the scale benefits 
in key areas around these axes.
 — Optimizing location—either geographically or  
in the customer value chain. Positioning is 
clearly important, and some banks have chosen 
to shape their footprint either transnationally in 
countries or domestically in states and provinces 
that show higher-than-average economic 
prospects. Other banks have occupied strategic 
positions along the value chain. For example,  
a European mortgage institution has moved up 
the commerce funnel by offering a home search 
capability to consumers rather than being 
relegated to the bottom of the funnel, where 
consumers looked for financing after  
finding their home.

"Analyze how outperforming banks’ revenue growth, risk, and scale strategies interact to boost returns.",,"Outperforming banks drive higher returns by integrating three key strategies: 

1. **Revenue Growth**: They achieve revenue growth that is 1.5 times their local GDP, focusing on expanding in segments or product types with strong potential but without over-concentrating risk.

2. **Risk Management**: Their risk costs are significantly lower than industry averages, both in magnitude and consistency through cycles, ensuring that growth does not come at the expense of stability.

3. **Scale**: Top banks find and exploit pockets where economies of scale exist—whether in marketing, wealth management, customer service, or custody operations—to maximize margins and productivity. Scale advantages are leveraged locally, regionally, or globally, further driving down efficiency ratios (below 50%).

These strategies interact synergistically: targeted growth brings in more revenue, careful risk controls preserve profits, and effective scaling reduces costs, collectively enhancing return on equity (ROE).","Exhibit 15

ROEs, like wealth and payments; a notable 
example is the mass affluent segment that, in 
many countries, composes the largest profit 
pool of wealth. Others have doubled down in 
capital markets to drive ROE-enhancing fee 
income growth. For most, these changes have 
been a handful of points of tilt in direction,  
not massive swings. But these winners have 
reallocated meaningful investments—in  
money, management bandwidth, and talent— 
to those tilts, and that has made a difference  
to their returns. 
 — Finding scale where it matters to drive 
productivity and acquisition. While in some 
countries, finding economies of scale is elusive 
at the overall industry level, scale does exist  
in pockets, and finding out how to harness it can 
thus have a significant effect. Some winners 
have found those pockets and doubled down on 
their position to create more margin by moving 
up the scale curve. Examples include finding 
economies of scale in marketing spending; in 
segments like retirement and wealth brokerage; 
and in parts of custody operations or customer 
servicing that are more standardized and where 
economies of scale therefore exist. Additionally, 
scale can be local, regional, national, or global, 
and the best banks maximize the scale benefits 
in key areas around these axes.
 — Optimizing location—either geographically or  
in the customer value chain. Positioning is 
clearly important, and some banks have chosen 
to shape their footprint either transnationally in 
countries or domestically in states and provinces 
that show higher-than-average economic 
prospects. Other banks have occupied strategic 
positions along the value chain. For example,  
a European mortgage institution has moved up 
the commerce funnel by offering a home search 
capability to consumers rather than being 
relegated to the bottom of the funnel, where 
consumers looked for financing after  
finding their home.

The outperformers’ revenue growth is 1.5 times  
their local GDP growth, their fee-to-revenue ratio  
is typically 40 percent or higher, their efficiency 
ratio is lower than 50 percent, and their risk costs 
are generally well-managed enough through  
the cycle to be significantly below their reference 
industry’s costs (in amplitude as well as  
absolute average).
Where to compete (structure)
Winners have at least one of three structural 
markers that drive their performance:
 — Picking and decisively committing to the right 
segments for growth while avoiding the trap of 
over-rotating into them. Investing in growth by 
client segment or product type but not tipping to 
a point of concentrating exposure is crucial.

How do CEOs’ strategic adaptations differ between high and low business model viability confidence levels?,,"CEOs who are more concerned about their business model’s viability (i.e., less confident) are doing somewhat more to adapt compared to those with higher confidence. They are especially more likely to form new strategic partnerships, shift from global to regional supply chains, and implement novel pricing models.","5

The intensification of CEO worries about corporate viability does not appear to reflect near-
term economic concerns. For example, CEOs are less likely than they were a year ago to 
anticipate a decline in global economic growth, and much more likely to expect growth 
will improve in 2024 (38% compared to 18% last year). Still, that doesn’t mean CEOs are 
unalloyed optimists: slightly more CEOs expect the global economy to contract in the 
coming year than expect it to improve. CEOs are also slightly less confident than last year  
in their own company’s prospects for revenue growth, over both the next 12 months and  
the next three years.

"Analyze CEOs' strategies balancing AI-driven business model shifts, trust-building, risk mitigation, and workforce reskilling.",,"CEOs are taking a balanced approach to AI by accelerating business model changes, enhancing trust, mitigating risks, and prioritizing workforce reskilling. According to PwC’s 27th Annual Global CEO Survey, roughly half of CEOs expect generative AI to help build stakeholder trust and improve product or service quality in the next year. Nearly 70% foresee significant business model changes and increased competitive intensity over the next three years, with most anticipating substantial new skill requirements for their workforce.

While AI adoption is rising, CEOs are keenly aware of associated risks—especially cybersecurity, misinformation, and legal liabilities. They are urged to set clear, risk-based priorities, establish rigorous controls for data privacy and model training, and ensure vendors uphold similar standards. Responsible AI integration and continuous regulatory monitoring are emphasized to balance innovation with ethical use, safeguarding both business and societal interests.","11

4. The AI opportunity
In addition to climate change, a second megatrend with systemic, existential implications is 
technological disruption. Specifically, our survey looked at generative AI, which has all the 
hallmarks of a technology that could significantly change how companies operate. It’s also 
approaching a critical juncture, seemingly poised to transform business models, redefine 
work processes and overhaul entire industries. 
CEOs in this year’s survey appear to believe in both the fast pace of generative AI adoption 
and its outsized potential for disruption. For example, over the next year, about half of CEOs 
expect generative AI to enhance their ability to build trust with stakeholders, and about 60% 
expect it to improve product or service quality. Within the next three years, nearly seven in 
ten respondents also anticipate generative AI will increase competition, drive changes to their 
business models and require new skills from their workforce. So far, experience apparently 
buoys expectations. CEOs who say they have adopted generative AI across their company 
(about one-third of our sample) are significantly more likely than others to anticipate its 
transformative potential over the next 12 months, as well as over the next three years. 
Although generative AI adoption 
and strategic integration has

Taken together, these findings underscore the societal obligation that CEOs have for 
ensuring their organisations use AI responsibly. Indeed, given the pace of innovation and the 
inevitable delay in establishing new norms and regulations, much of the onus for managing 
this advancing technology falls, for now, to businesses. As Robert Playter, CEO of Boston 
Dynamics (a robotics manufacturer), told us in a recent interview , ‘While there are potential 
risks with [AI and large language models], we believe more in its potential and creating 
boundaries to mitigate any risk. This integration, like all applications of our robots, must

purposes of harm or intimidation.’
Your next move: Move fast, move responsibly. In the rush to explore generative AI’s 
potential, don’t overlook its potential pitfalls, as these too may evolve quickly. The key

SEATTLE—(BUSINESS WIRE) May 1, 2025—Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced financial results for 
its first quarter ended March 31, 2025. 
• Net sales increased 9% to $155.7 billion in the first quarter, compared with $143.3 billion in first quarter 2024.
Excluding the $1.4 billion unfavorable impact from year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates throughout the
quarter, net sales increased 10% compared with first quarter 2024.
• North America segment sales increased 8% year-over-year to $92.9 billion.
• International segment sales increased 5% year-over-year to $33.5 billion, or increased 8% excluding changes
in foreign exchange rates.
• AWS segment sales increased 17% year-over-year to $29.3 billion.
• Operating income increased to $18.4 billion in the first quarter, compared with $15.3 billion in first quarter 2024.
• North America segment operating income was $5.8 billion, compared with $5.0 billion in first quarter 2024.
• International segment operating income was $1.0 billion, compared with $0.9 billion in first quarter 2024.
• AWS segment operating income was $11.5 billion, compared with $9.4 billion in first quarter 2024.
• Net income increased to $17.1 billion in the first quarter, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared with $10.4 billion, or
$0.98 per diluted share, in first quarter 2024.
• Operating cash flow increased 15% to $113.9 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $99.1 billion for
the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024.
• Free cash flow decreased to $25.9 billion for the trailing twelve months, compared with $50.1 billion for the trailing

“We’re pleased with the start to 2025, especially our pace of innovation and progress in continuing to improve customer 
experiences,” said Andy Jassy, President and CEO, Amazon. “From Alexa+ (our next generation of Alexa that’s meaningfully 
smarter, more capable, and takes actions for customers), to another delivery speed record for our Prime members, to our new 
Trainium2 chips and Bedrock model expansion that make it easier for AWS customers to train models and run inference more 
flexibly and cost-effectively, to our first Project Kuiper satellites successfully launching into low earth orbit in our quest to 
provide broadband access to hundreds of millions of households in rural areas without it today—we’re continuing to find 
meaningful ways to make customers’ lives easier and better every day.”
Some other highlights since the company’s last earnings announcement include that Amazon:
• Introduced Alexa+, our next-generation Alexa personal assistant who’s meaningfully smarter and more capable than
her prior self, can both answer virtually any question and take actions, and is free with Prime.
• Held deal events worldwide to help customers save over $500 million across Big Spring Sale in the U.S. and Canada,
Spring Deal Days in Europe, and Ramadan/Eid Sale events in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Türkiye, and UAE.
• Announced Amazon’s 11th Prime Day will be in July, when customers can expect millions of deals globally on vast
selection.
• Announced $4 billion investment through 2026 to expand Amazon’s rural delivery network to bring even faster
delivery to customers in less densely populated areas across the U.S.",./dataset_2/quarter_income\AMZN-Q1-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf
Compare new AI-driven features launched in Q1’25 with both Amazon’s expanded luxury offerings and Project Kuiper.,,"In Q1’25, Amazon launched new AI-driven features such as ‘Interests’—which uses generative AI to help customers discover products related to their passions and hobbies—and enhanced ways to shop in the Amazon app, including the 'Buy for Me' feature that enables seamless purchases from other brands' websites.

Compared to Amazon’s expanded luxury offerings (like launching Saks on Amazon with brands such as Dolce&Gabbana and Balmain), these AI features focus on personalized discovery and convenience rather than broadening product assortment or shifting into new market segments. The luxury initiative is about curating premium fashion and beauty products, while the AI upgrades center on enhancing the shopping experience through technology.

In contrast, Project Kuiper represents an infrastructure innovation rather than a retail or customer-facing feature. In Q1’25, Amazon began full-scale deployment of its satellite internet network, aiming to provide broadband to rural and underserved areas, which addresses connectivity challenges at a global scale.

In summary: The new AI features enhance customer experience and personalization in shopping; the luxury offerings expand product selection into high-end markets; and Project Kuiper is a technological infrastructure initiative for global satellite internet—each contributing to Amazon’s growth in different strategic ways.","• Launched Amazon.ie in Ireland, offering over 200 million products with low prices, fast delivery, and local Prime

"Compare Amazon’s recent retail expansions, AI initiatives, and major AWS developments in terms of scope and impact.",,"Amazon’s recent activities span significant retail expansions, advanced AI initiatives, and major AWS developments:

**Retail Expansions:**  
Amazon launched Amazon.ie in Ireland with over 200 million products, expanded product selections (Michael Kors, GAME 7, luxury via Saks on Amazon), and introduced new app features like generative AI-powered ‘Interests’ and the ‘Buy for Me’ tool enabling shopping from other brands’ sites. These moves broaden Amazon’s retail footprint and enhance customer choice, convenience, and access to both mainstream and luxury brands, supporting continued sales growth (Q1 retail sales up across segments).

**AI Initiatives:**  
Amazon unveiled major advancements with Amazon Nova, offering speech-to-speech AI (Nova Sonic), agent-building tools (Nova Act SDK), and powerful multimodal models (Nova Premier). These innovations enable developers to build advanced AI applications—improving customer service, workflow automation, and document understanding. The generative AI-powered search and recommendations also deepen engagement and provide more personalized shopping experiences.

**AWS Developments:**  
AWS signed new high-profile enterprise contracts (Adobe, Uber, Nasdaq, etc.), introduced enhanced hybrid cloud offerings (Outposts racks/servers), broadened foundational AI models in Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.7, DeepSeek’s R1, Meta’s Llama 4, and Mistral AI), and expanded Nova model availability globally. AWS also launched new quantum computing hardware (Ocelot) and improved SageMaker and QuickSight. These advancements reinforce AWS’s position as a cloud and AI leader, reflected in a 17% year-over-year revenue increase and widespread enterprise adoption.

Analyze AWS Q1 2025 operating income growth vs International and North America segment operating growth.,,"In Q1 2025, AWS operating income grew to $11.5 billion from $9.4 billion in Q1 2024, marking an increase of $2.1 billion. This growth outpaced both the International segment, which increased operating income by $0.1 billion (from $0.9 billion to $1.0 billion), and the North America segment, which increased by $0.8 billion (from $5.0 billion to $5.8 billion). Thus, AWS showed the largest absolute and relative operating income growth among Amazon’s segments.","Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of May 1, 2025, and are subject to substantial 
uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in 
foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand 
and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world 
events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, and the various 
factors detailed below. 
Second Quarter 2025 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $159.0 billion and $164.0 billion, or to grow between 7% and 11% compared 
with second quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates an unfavorable impact of approximately 10 basis points from 
foreign exchange rates.  
• Operating income is expected to be between $13.0 billion and $17.5 billion, compared with $14.7 billion in second 
quarter 2024.  
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal 
settlements are concluded.
Conference Call Information
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:00 p.m. PT/5:00 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at

financial and operating results.
Forward-Looking Statements
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a 
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business 
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales 
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management 
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, 
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of 
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops 
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of 
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, 
services, and technologies, security incidents, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, 
global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give 
rise to or amplify many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial 
results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent

"Evaluate the combined effects of macroeconomic/geopolitical shifts, innovation, and legal challenges on AMZN’s Q2 guidance.",,"Amazon’s Q2 2025 guidance reflects the combined influence of macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts, innovation, and legal challenges:

- **Macroeconomic/Geopolitical Shifts:** Amazon warns that factors such as foreign exchange fluctuations, inflation, interest rates, global economic and geopolitical conditions, regional labor constraints, and recessionary fears contribute significant uncertainty to its results. The Q2 guidance already anticipates an unfavorable FX impact of about 10 basis points on net sales.

- **Innovation:** The company’s ongoing innovation—such as new Alexa+, AWS advancements, and Project Kuiper—drives growth in core segments and supports long-term competitiveness. These initiatives underpin expectations for Q2 sales growth (7–11% year-over-year), even amid economic uncertainty.

- **Legal Challenges:** The guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements. However, potential claims, litigation, government investigations, and regulatory changes represent risks that could materially affect future results.

In summary, while Amazon’s Q2 2025 outlook demonstrates solid growth driven by technological innovation, it remains highly susceptible to macroeconomic, geopolitical, and legal variables, which could lead to material deviations from expected performance.","Financial Guidance

"Analyze Costco’s Q4 2024 and 2023: how do cash flows from operations, investments, and financing interrelate?",,"In Q4 2024, Costco generated $3,260 million in cash from operating activities, which is lower than the $4,651 million generated in Q4 2023. This operational cash flow funded investing activities (mostly additions to property and equipment), which used $985 million in Q4 2024 versus $366 million in Q4 2023.

Meanwhile, Costco used $1,193 million in financing activities in Q4 2024 (more than the $974 million used in Q4 2023), mainly for dividends, stock repurchases, and debt repayments.

Overall, despite lower operating cash flow in Q4 2024 and higher outflows for investing and financing, Costco still grew its cash and cash equivalents by $1,001 million. This indicates that strong operating cash flows continue to support both investments in growth and returns to shareholders. Cash flows from operations are the primary source funding both investment and financing outflows.","COST-Earn

Analyze the interplay of deferred tax assets and non-cash expenses in COST’s quarterly profit rise.,,"Based on the provided financial statements, COST's (Costco Wholesale Corporation) quarterly profit rose from $1,589 million to $1,798 million year-over-year. While specific figures for deferred tax assets are not disclosed in the context, non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization ($548M vs. $501M), stock-based compensation ($463M vs. $444M), and non-cash lease expense ($72M vs. $74M) are noted in the cash flow adjustments.

These non-cash expenses reduce taxable income and reportable pre-tax profit, but since they do not represent actual cash outflows, they positively impact operating cash flow ($3,260M vs. $4,651M). Deferred tax assets typically arise from timing differences in recognizing these expenses for tax versus accounting purposes, further supporting profit and cash flow stability.

In summary, the interplay of higher non-cash expenses and associated deferred tax benefits helped maintain strong cash flows and contributed to COST's quarterly profit increase.","Total current liabilities   38,289     35,464 OTHER LIABILITIES     Long-term debt, excluding current portion  5,745     5,794 Long-term operating lease liabilities   2,288     2,375 Other long-term liabilities   2,613     2,576

Q1 
Total operating expenses  
Q1/Q1: Total operating expenses were up 5%, of which 4 
percentage points was driven by strategic investments in 
several areas, including technology, data and AI, digital 
services and cyber security. Inflation and running costs for the 
recent acquisition of Danske Bank’s Norwegian personal 
customer and private banking business also contributed to the 
increase. Exchange rate effects made a positive contribution 
of approximately EUR 3m. 
 
Q1/Q4: Total operating expenses were down 6%. The decline

Analyze how shifts in income and separate expense components affected both Q1/Q1 and Q1/Q4 operating profits.,,"In Q1 2025 versus Q1 2024 (Q1/Q1), Nordea’s operating profit decreased by 9% to EUR 1,607m, mainly due to lower income and higher expenses. Total operating expenses rose 5%, driven primarily by increased strategic investments (technology, data, AI, digital services, cyber security), inflation, integration costs from the Danske Bank Norwegian acquisition, and increased staff (FTEs up 3%). Staff costs (+6%) and other expenses (+6%) both increased, while regulatory fees fell (EUR 54m vs. 63m). Depreciation and amortisation were up EUR 10m.

Comparing Q1 2025 to the previous quarter (Q1/Q4), operating profit improved by 10%, also reaching EUR 1,607m. This was mainly due to higher income and a 6% decline in total operating expenses. The drop in expenses resulted from seasonally lower staff costs (-3%) and substantially reduced other expenses (-20%) after traditionally higher Q4 business activity and variable pay. However, this was partly offset by regulatory fees rising to EUR 54m (up EUR 35m due to resolution fees). Depreciation/amortisation was nearly flat (+EUR 1m), and FTEs rose 1%, having less impact on costs.

In summary, Q1/Q1 profit was pressured by both higher costs and lower income, while the Q1/Q4 improvement was primarily due to cost reductions outpacing fee increases, alongside better income and reduced loan losses.","Nordea First-Quarter Financial Report 2025

"How did regional NII and lending/deposit trends, plus fee/commission changes, drive LC&I’s 10% y/y drop?",,"LC&I’s net interest income (NII) dropped 10% year-on-year, mainly due to declines across all key regions: Denmark (-6%), Finland (-16%), Norway (-16%), and Sweden (-7%). This was driven by lower margins, despite relatively stable lending and deposit volumes overall (lending down 1%, deposits up 17%). Fee and commission income also fell sharply (-16% y/y), with notable decreases in Finland (-35%), Denmark (-8%), and Norway (-13%), partly offset by Sweden (+21%). These combined declines in both NII and fees—especially in Finland and Norway—drove LC&I’s total income down and contributed directly to the 10% year-on-year drop in NII.","Nordea First-Quarter Financial Report 2025

How do Nordea's AML legal risks and fines compare with operational risks like credit losses?,,"Nordea faces both AML (anti-money laundering) legal risks and operational risks such as credit losses, but their natures and financial impacts differ:

- **AML Legal Risks and Fines:** Nordea is subject to ongoing regulatory investigations regarding AML compliance, particularly in Denmark, where it has been charged for weak AML processes. The bank expects to be fined and has made provisions for these matters, though there is uncertainty about whether the fines will match the provisions, posing potential upside or downside risk to financial results. Such legal issues can also lead to reputational damage and further sanctions.

- **Operational Risks (Credit Losses):** Credit risk is managed through provisions for expected credit losses, which are sensitive to macroeconomic changes and credit ratings. As of Q1 2025, total allowances for credit losses were EUR 1,636m, with additional management judgement allowances of EUR 397m, reflecting significant operational risk exposure. These credit risks are mainly related to lending, investment services, and exposures to specific sectors or counterparties.

**Comparison:** While AML risks may result in one-off fines and reputational harm, operational risks like credit losses are larger in scale (provisions totaling over EUR 2 billion including management judgement), ongoing, and influenced by the wider macroeconomic environment. However, should AML fines or sanctions be greater than anticipated, they could have a material impact. Currently, none of the legal claims or operational risks are considered likely to have a significant adverse effect on Nordea’s financial position, but both risks are actively monitored and provisioned for.","Nordea First-Quarter Financial Report 2025

Q1 
Note 15 Risks and uncertainties 
 
Nordea is subject to various legal regimes and 
requirements, including but not limited to those of the 
Nordic countries, the European Union and the United 
States. The supervisory and governmental authorities 
administering and enforcing these regimes make regular 
enquiries and conduct investigations with regard to 
Nordea’s compliance. Areas subject to investigation may 
include investment advice, anti-money laundering (AML), 
trade regulation and sanctions adherence, tax rules, 
competition law, consumer protection, governance, risk 
management and control. The outcome and timing of these 
enquiries and investigations are unclear and pending. 
Accordingly, it cannot be ruled out that these enquiries and 
investigations could lead to criticism against the bank, 
reputation loss, fines, sanctions, disputes and/or litigation. 
 
In June 2015 the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority 
investigated how Nordea Bank Danmark A/S had followed 
the regulations regarding AML. The outcome resulted in 
criticism and, in accordance with Danish administrative 
practice, the matter was handed over to the police for 
further handling and possible sanctions. On 5 July 2024 the 
Danish National Special Crime Unit filed a formal charge 
against Nordea in the matter. As previously stated, Nordea 
has expected to be fined in Denmark for weak AML 
processes and procedures in the past and has made a 
provision for ongoing AML-related matters. 
 
There is a risk that, in the event fines are issued by 
authorities or by final court decisions, the related costs 
could be higher (or potentially lower) than the current 
provision, and this could also impact Nordea’s financial 
performance. Nordea believes that the current provision is 
adequate to cover these matters.
 
Within the framework of normal business operations, 
Nordea faces a number of operational and legal risks that 
could result in reputational impacts, fines, sanctions, 
disputes, remediation costs, losses and/or litigation. 
Specifically, Nordea faces potential claims related to the 
provision of banking and investment services and other 
areas in which it operates. Currently, such claims are 
mainly related to lending and insolvency situations, various 
investment services, and sub-custody and withholding 
taxation matters. At present, none of the current claims are 
considered likely to have any significant adverse effect on 
Nordea or its financial position. 
 
There are significant risks related to the macroeconomic 
environment due to the ongoing geopolitical developments 
and trade tensions. Reduced consumer spending and 
lower activity may particularly impact small and medium-
sized enterprises in certain industries. Depending on future 
developments, there may be increased credit risk in 
Nordea’s portfolio. Furthermore, potential adverse impacts 
on income could arise due to financial market volatility and 
reduced banking activity impacting transaction volumes 
and customer activity. Potential future credit risks are 
addressed in Note 11 and the section “Net loan losses and 
similar net result”. Depending on the duration and 
magnitude of the situation, there is a possibility that Nordea 
will not be able to meet its financial targets in very adverse 
scenarios. In addition, Nordea recognises an increase in 
the risk of hybrid warfare impacting its operations as a 
consequence of the geopolitical situation.|Nordea First-Quarter Financial Report 2025

Forward-looking information  
Forward-looking information is used for both assessing significant increases in credit risk and calculating expected credit losses. Nordea uses three macroeconomic 
scenarios: a baseline scenario, a favourable scenario and an adverse scenario. The macroeconomic scenarios are provided by Gr oup Risk in Nordea, based on the 
Oxford Economics Model. The forecast is a combination of modelling and expert judgement, subject to thorough checks and quali ty control processes. The model 
has been built to give a good description of the historical relationships between econom ic variables and to capture the key linkages between those variables. The 
forecast period in the model is ten years. For periods beyond, a long -term average is used in the ECL calculations. 
 
The macroeconomic scenarios reflect Nordea’s view of how the Nordic economies might develop in the light of continued geopolitical uncertainty, trade conflicts and 
weak growth in major European economies. When developing the scenarios and determining the relative weighting between them, N ordea took into account 
projections made by Nordic central banks, Nordea Research and the European Central Bank.  
 
The baseline scenario foresees soft landings in the Nordic economies, with unemployment largely unchanged in the coming years . Denmark will see relatively high 
growth, driven by the pharmaceutical sector and the reopening of North Sea oil and gas fields. T he other Nordic countries will see higher growth in 2025, with 
Finland emerging from a mild recession. The stronger growth outlook is supported by weaker inflation and lower interest rates . The exception is Norway, where the 
weak currency and relatively high activity levels have led the central bank to keep interest rates constant. A modest recovery in home prices is expected to  continue 
over the coming years, supported by rising household purchasing power. The risks around the baseline forecast are tilted to the downside, with the favourable 
scenario deviating less from the baseline than the adverse.  
 
Nordea’s two alternative macroeconomic scenarios cover a range of plausible risk factors which may cause growth to deviate from the baseline scenario. An 
escalation of the trade conflict between the US and several countries could trigger a European and Nordic recession as firms postpone investments, exports slow 
down and households cut spending due to weakening labour markets. Central banks may in addition regard the inflationary impulse from h igher tariffs as temporary 
and continue cutting interest rates, with rates moving lower than in the baseline scenario in 2025. Nor malising inflation and lower interest rates, on the other hand, 
may lead to a stronger recovery than assumed in the baseline scenario.  
 
At the end of the first quarter of 2025 adjustments to model -based allowances/provisions amounted to EUR 453m, including management judgements. The 
management judgement allowances cover expected credit losses not yet adequately captured by the IFRS 9 modelled outcomes. Dur ing the quarter, allowance 
levels were reassessed and EUR 20m was released due to the impro ved macroeconomic outlook, including lower inflation and interest rate levels. The management 
judgement allowances remain at high levels due to increased macroeconomic uncertainty and uncertainty regarding central forec asts. Total management judgement 
allowances decreased to EUR 397m. 
 
During the first quarter Nordea continued to closely monitor and assess its direct exposure to Russian counterparties. At the  end of the quarter the direct credit 
exposure after provisions was less than EUR 20m.",./dataset_2/quarter_income\q1-2025-interim-report-1.pdf
Assess the effects of abrupt geopolitical shocks on Nordea’s stress test credit loss projections.,,"Abrupt geopolitical shocks increase the downside risks in Nordea’s stress test credit loss projections by raising macroeconomic uncertainty, potentially leading to higher credit losses. According to the context, such shocks could trigger recessions in the Nordic and European economies, resulting in postponed investments, slower exports, and reduced consumer spending due to weaker labour markets. These factors may lead to increased credit risk in Nordea’s loan portfolio and higher default rates, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises. The adverse scenario used in Nordea’s projections reflects these risks, and management has maintained high allowances, with EUR 397m in management judgement overlays, to account for uncertainty not captured by modelled outcomes. Therefore, abrupt geopolitical shocks can materially increase projected credit losses and may cause Nordea to miss its financial targets in severe scenarios.","Nordea First-Quarter Financial Report 2025

down and households cut spending due to weakening labour markets. Central banks may in addition regard the inflationary impulse from h igher tariffs as temporary 
and continue cutting interest rates, with rates moving lower than in the baseline scenario in 2025. Nor malising inflation and lower interest rates, on the other hand, 
may lead to a stronger recovery than assumed in the baseline scenario.  
 
At the end of the first quarter of 2025 adjustments to model -based allowances/provisions amounted to EUR 453m, including management judgements. The 
management judgement allowances cover expected credit losses not yet adequately captured by the IFRS 9 modelled outcomes. Dur ing the quarter, allowance 
levels were reassessed and EUR 20m was released due to the impro ved macroeconomic outlook, including lower inflation and interest rate levels. The management 
judgement allowances remain at high levels due to increased macroeconomic uncertainty and uncertainty regarding central forec asts. Total management judgement 
allowances decreased to EUR 397m. 
 
During the first quarter Nordea continued to closely monitor and assess its direct exposure to Russian counterparties. At the  end of the quarter the direct credit 
exposure after provisions was less than EUR 20m.",./dataset_2/quarter_income\q1-2025-interim-report-1.pdf

"How did Flipkart, Walmex, Canada investments and $0.2B currency loss affect Walmart Int’l income YoY?",,"Walmart International’s operating income declined 17.5% year-over-year, from $1.5 billion to $1.3 billion, largely due to increased strategic growth investments in Flipkart, Walmex, and Canada. Additionally, currency rate fluctuations resulted in a $0.2 billion negative impact, further reducing operating income. In constant currency, the decline was smaller at 6.4%, highlighting that both investments and currency losses were key drivers of the year-over-year decrease.","Walmart Inc.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorganChase's First-Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. 
Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's 
website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by.  
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and the Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy 
Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase 
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 
billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. 
 
On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. 
Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances 
in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well 
as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, 
largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue 
was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. 
 
Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office 
and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. 
 
The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior 
quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the 
reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. 
 
Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several 
weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the 
quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with 
the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up 
from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. 
 
So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The 
wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as 
changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by 
deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. 
 
With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the 
prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 
billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which 
has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal 
effects. 
 
Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent 
downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit 
utilization are all in line with our expectations. 
 
Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & 
Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management 
revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter.|2 
Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into 
managed products. 
 
In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. 
 
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as 
higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 
billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. 
 
Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as 
well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, 
predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build 
was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. 
 
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year-
on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from 
the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in 
Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. 
 
In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is 
quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of 
uncertainty. 
 
Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly 
offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower 
balances. 
 
Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better 
performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well 
during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. 
 
Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin 
compression. 
 
Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average 
Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited 
demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased 
activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. 
 
Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin 
of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher 
average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. 
 
Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and 
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the 
quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. 
 
AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And 
finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. 
 
Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of 
$1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year. 
The current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic) 
[$366] million.",./dataset_2/pt2\1q25-earnings-transcript.pdf
How do consumer and wholesale reserve builds differ in response to macro outlook and downside scenario changes?,,"The consumer reserve build of $441 million was mainly driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, reflecting adjustments to higher downside risk probabilities. The wholesale reserve build of $549 million, on the other hand, was driven by both credit quality changes on certain exposures, net lending activity, and changes to the macroeconomic outlook. Thus, while both increased due to a more cautious view on economic risks, the wholesale build also reflected specific changes in portfolio credit quality and lending activity, not just macro scenarios.","1

Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into 
managed products. 
 
In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. 
 
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as 
higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 
billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. 
 
Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as 
well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, 
predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build 
was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. 
 
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year-
on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from 
the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in 
Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. 
 
In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is 
quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of 
uncertainty. 
 
Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly 
offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower 
balances. 
 
Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better 
performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well 
during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives. 
 
Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin 
compression. 
 
Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average 
Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited 
demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased 
activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build. 
 
Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin 
of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher 
average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances. 
 
Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and 
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the 
quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion. 
 
AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And 
finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially. 
 
Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of 
$1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year.

MANAG EMENT DISCUSSION SECTI ON 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorganChase's First-Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. 
Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. The presentation is available on JPMorganChase's 
website. Please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forward-looking statements. Please stand by.  
 
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorganChase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and the Chief Financial Officer, Jeremy 
Barnum. Mr. Barnum, please go ahead. 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase 
Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46 
billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K. 
 
On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex. 
Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances 
in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well 
as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%, 
largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue 
was up $1.7 billion, or 21%. 
 
Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office 
and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense. 
 
The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior 
quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the 
reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion. 
 
Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several 
weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the 
quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with 
the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up 
from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance. 
 
So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The 
wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as 
changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by 
deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations. 
 
With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the 
prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11 
billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which 
has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal 
effects. 
 
Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent 
downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit 
utilization are all in line with our expectations. 
 
Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking & 
Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management 
revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter.|2 
Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into 
managed products. 
 
In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market. 
 
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as 
higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7 
billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume. 
 
Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as 
well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year, 
predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build 
was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card. 
 
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year-
on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from 
the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in 
Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions.

offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower 
balances.

Which unresolved econ variables and sector-specific risks cause Dimon/Barnum caution in predicting recession timing?,,"Jamie Dimon and Jeremy Barnum express caution in predicting recession timing due to several unresolved economic variables and sector-specific risks. Dimon highlights ""a lot of issues out there"" and notes that many may resolve in the next few months, affecting future clarity. Both emphasize that outcomes depend on variables like unemployment (especially for consumer credit), the trajectory of sticky inflation, potential volatility in treasury and financial markets, and uncertainties around government policy (like rules and regulations affecting the treasury market). Sector-specific risks mentioned include which sectors might be most impacted, and the idiosyncratic nature of risks within wholesale versus consumer segments. Overall, unpredictability in these factors makes precise forecasts difficult at this stage.","14 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A 
It’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I 
can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess 
that. 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A 
I'll just – I'll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen which is different, it's not the risk 
off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.

Good morning.

Betsy L. Graseck 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. 
And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming 
forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen? 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A 
An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally 
like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those 
issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months. 
 
So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was 
with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go 
up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been 
quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can|6 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A 
We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual 
mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, 
idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. 
 
I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor 
market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.

John McDonald 
Analyst, Truist Securities Inc. Q 
Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the 
rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for 
next year, or just too early to call?

Ebrahim Poonawala 
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q 
Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a 
matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, 
maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great. 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A 
Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that 
relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly 
differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and 
regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that 
happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it 
when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. 
 
But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. 
Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So 
we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.

Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about

trajectory and jumping off point into next year.

"Compare concerns over the 10-yr Treasury market to prior interventions by the Fed, including timing.",,"Concerns over the current 10-year Treasury market center on rapid rate increases and questions about market functioning, with mention that the yield moved from 3.99% to 4.50% in just a week. Jamie Dimon noted that similar “kerfuffles” have happened before during periods of stress, such as COVID, and that in those cases the Fed stepped in to stabilize the market—but only after significant issues emerged and “panic” set in. He emphasized that this intervention is reactive: “They’re not going to do it now because you don’t have all those issues yet. They’ll do it when they start to panic a little bit, and we don’t know if and when that’s going to happen.” In summary, current concerns are being closely watched, and historical interventions by the Fed came only after market dysfunction became clear, not preemptively.","14

Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the 
rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for 
next year, or just too early to call?

Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a 
matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT, 
maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great. 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A 
Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that 
relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly 
differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and 
regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that 
happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it 
when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see. 
 
But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits. 
Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So 
we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.

Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about 
the trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that 
trajectory and jumping off point into next year.

How does JPMorganChase use weighted-average unemployment as the key driver in consumer card net charge-off forecasts amid rising recession risk?,,"JPMorganChase uses weighted-average unemployment as a key variable to explain and forecast consumer card net charge-offs because unemployment is the most important driver of consumer credit performance. As Jeremy Barnum, CFO, noted, if the labor market remains strong, consumer credit should hold up well; if unemployment rises, charge-offs typically increase. While recession risk is rising, Barnum emphasized that the actual impact on charge-offs depends primarily on unemployment trends, and the mechanisms and timing can be complex. Therefore, their forecasts account for current unemployment expectations, but there remains a wide range of potential outcomes if the economic situation deteriorates.","14 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A 
It’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I 
can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess 
that. 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A 
I'll just – I'll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen which is different, it's not the risk 
off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.

Good morning.

Betsy L. Graseck 
Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q 
Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress. 
And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming 
forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen? 
........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
Jamie Dimon 
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorganChase A 
An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally 
like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those 
issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months. 
 
So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was 
with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go 
up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been 
quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can|6 
Jeremy Barnum 
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A 
We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual 
mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits, 
idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot. 
 
I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor 
market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.

What % of temporary employees who requested raises in 2022 successfully received pay increases?,,"The context does not provide the specific percentage of temporary employees who requested raises in 2022 and successfully received pay increases.

This share was similar in 2021 and was up 4 per-centage points from 2019, before the pandemic.Those who searched for a job also frequently found new work. Among people who applied for anew job, 52 percent reported starting a new job in 2022, up 3 percentage points from 2021 andup 7 percentage points from 2019.Work Arrangements and Autonomy at WorkIn addition to pay, other important dimensions of job quality are the duration of jobs, job schedulesand autonomy. Seven percent of working adults (4 percent of all adults) said their main job was atemporary position. These temporary positions were most frequent among young workers andolder workers. Nine percent of workers under age 30, and 11 percent of those age 60 or older,indicated that they had a temporary position, compared with 5 percent of workers between ages30 and 59.Although many people have regular work schedules, this is not the case for all workers.

This includes 16 per-cent who had a work schedule that varied based on their employer’s needs, and 11 percent whoseschedule varied at their own request.Employees were also asked about how much choice they had to decide what tasks to work on andhow to do those tasks.

Black and Hispanicemployees were also less likely to report thatthey chose how to complete tasks.Reasons for Not WorkingTwenty-three percent of prime-age adults (ages25 to 54) were not working in the monthbefore the survey, matching the share who were not working in 2021. This share is less than the26 percent who were not working in 2020 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic but isgreater than the 21 percent not working in 2019, before the pandemic.21Health limitations or disability, as well as family or personal obligations besides childcare, werethe most commonly cited reasons for not working, followed by an inability to find work. Consistentwith the continued strength of the labor market, the 6 percent of prime-age adults said that theywere not working because they could not find work was similar to the share of adults who citedthis reason in 2021 (5 percent), and in late 2019, before the pandemic (5 percent).Notable differences existed in prime-age employment rates by gender. Twenty-eight percent ofprime-age women were not working, compared with 18 percent of prime-age men.This difference may reflect greater family and childcare responsibilities held by women. Prime-agewomen were more likely than men to cite both childcare and other family or personal obligations20The different types of jobs people work in based on their level of education is likely a contributing factor for these differ-ences in levels of autonomy by education. For example, 40 percent of business and professional services workers—most of whom have a bachelor’s degree—say that they often or always chose what tasks to work on, while a lower26 percent of transportation and utilities workers—most of whom have less than a bachelor’s degree—say they havethis level of control over their work.21Despite differences in question wording, this pattern is consistent with that observed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,which reported 20 percent of prime-age adults not working in October 2022, down from 24 percent not working at thetime of the survey in 2020, and similar to the percent in October 2019.

"Which specific health limitations or family obligations excluded prime-age, highly educated adults from employment?",,"The context does not specify which particular health limitations or family obligations excluded prime-age, highly educated adults from employment. It only states that health limitations or disability, as well as family or personal obligations besides childcare, were the most commonly cited reasons for not working among prime-age adults—as a whole—noting that women were more likely to cite family and childcare responsibilities. No additional detail is provided for highly educated adults specifically.","18 percent applied for a new job and 11 percent started one. These indicators of how workers arefaring in the job market were either similar to or above that seen in the prior year for each educa-tion group.Most people who asked for a raise received one. Among those who asked for a raise in 2022,70 percent also said that they received a raise. This share was similar in 2021 and was up 4 per-centage points from 2019, before the pandemic.Those who searched for a job also frequently found new work. Among people who applied for anew job, 52 percent reported starting a new job in 2022, up 3 percentage points from 2021 andup 7 percentage points from 2019.Work Arrangements and Autonomy at WorkIn addition to pay, other important dimensions of job quality are the duration of jobs, job schedulesand autonomy. Seven percent of working adults (4 percent of all adults) said their main job was atemporary position. These temporary positions were most frequent among young workers andolder workers. Nine percent of workers under age 30, and 11 percent of those age 60 or older,indicated that they had a temporary position, compared with 5 percent of workers between ages30 and 59.Although many people have regular work schedules, this is not the case for all workers. More thanone-fourth (27 percent) of employees had irregular work schedules in 2022. This includes 16 per-cent who had a work schedule that varied based on their employer’s needs, and 11 percent whoseschedule varied at their own request.Employees were also asked about how much choice they had to decide what tasks to work on andhow to do those tasks. In general, employees were more likely to have control over how to com-plete tasks than which tasks they worked on. Nearly 6 in 10 employees said they often or alwayschose how to complete tasks, compared with 37 percent who said they often or always chosewhich tasks to work on.Employees with at least a bachelor’s degree reported higher levels of autonomy at work thanthose with lower levels of education (table 6). Forty-four percent of employees with at least a bach-elor’s degree said they often or always chose what tasks to work on, and more than two-thirds saidthey chose how to complete tasks. In contrast, around one-third (32 percent) of employees without

For those currently working from home, the likelihood oflooking for another job after a full-time in-person work requirement is consistent with that expectedfrom a 2 to 3 percent pay cut.
Job Searching and AdvancementIndicators of workers’ opportunities for newpositions and pay advancement strengthenedcompared with 2021, as the share whoreceived a raise, asked for a raise, or volun-tarily left a job increased, while the share wholost a job decreased. Thirty-three percent ofadults said they received a raise or a promo-tion in the prior 12 months, up slightly from2021.19A higher share also said they askedfor a raise or promotion in 2022 than during2021 (figure 16). Five percent of adults lost ajob during the prior year, down from 7 percentin 2021.Adults with more education were more likely toask for or receive a raise than those with lesseducation. They also were more likely to haveapplied to a new job, started a new job, or vol-untarily left a job in the prior year.

Black and Hispanicemployees were also less likely to report thatthey chose how to complete tasks.Reasons for Not WorkingTwenty-three percent of prime-age adults (ages25 to 54) were not working in the monthbefore the survey, matching the share who were not working in 2021. This share is less than the26 percent who were not working in 2020 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic but isgreater than the 21 percent not working in 2019, before the pandemic.21Health limitations or disability, as well as family or personal obligations besides childcare, werethe most commonly cited reasons for not working, followed by an inability to find work. Consistentwith the continued strength of the labor market, the 6 percent of prime-age adults said that theywere not working because they could not find work was similar to the share of adults who citedthis reason in 2021 (5 percent), and in late 2019, before the pandemic (5 percent).Notable differences existed in prime-age employment rates by gender. Twenty-eight percent ofprime-age women were not working, compared with 18 percent of prime-age men.This difference may reflect greater family and childcare responsibilities held by women. Prime-agewomen were more likely than men to cite both childcare and other family or personal obligations20The different types of jobs people work in based on their level of education is likely a contributing factor for these differ-ences in levels of autonomy by education.

"How do views on education’s value differ by college completion, institution type, and student loan status?",,"Views on education’s value are more positive among those who completed a degree, attended public or private nonprofit institutions, and do not have outstanding student loans. Specifically:

- **College Completion**: 68% of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree said the benefits of education exceeded the costs, compared to 42% with an associate degree and only 30% who did not complete a degree.
- **Institution Type**: 53% of public institution attendees and 58% of private nonprofit institution attendees saw financial benefits as greater than costs, but only 31% from for-profit institutions agreed.
- **Student Loan Status**: 43% of adults with outstanding student loans felt the benefits outweighed the costs, versus 53% of those who had paid off loans or never had debt. 

Overall, completing a degree, choosing a public or nonprofit institution, and avoiding long-term student loans are linked to more favorable views on the value of higher education.","Higher Education and Student LoansEducation is widely recognized as a path to higher income and greater financial well-being, andmost adults who attended college feel that the investment paid off. However, some groups—including those who started college but did not complete their degree and those who attended pri-vate for-profit institutions—had less favorable assessments. Additionally, student loans continueto relate to people’s perceptions of the returns to their education as they evaluate whether theireducational choices improved their financial well-being.Educational AttainmentMost adults have enrolled in at least somepost-secondary education. Seventy percent ofadults have ever enrolled in an educationaldegree program beyond high school, whereasjust under one-half have received at least acertificate or technical degree, and 36 percenthave received at least a bachelor’s degree.However, consistent with increasing rates ofcollege attendance over time, the share ofadults who have ever enrolled in a degree pro-gram after high school was higher for youngeradults than for older adults (table 32).42Col-lege attendance rates also vary substantiallyby race and ethnicity, with Hispanic adultsbeing much less likely than others to haveever attended college, while Asian adults weremore likely than average to have attendedcollege.The likelihood of obtaining a college degreewas higher among those whose parents werecollege graduates. Among adults who have atleast one parent with a bachelor's degree,42Though college enrollment rates among recent high school completers peaked at about 70 percent in 2009 and havesince stagnated or fallen, enrollment rates remain historically high, averaging more than two-thirds of recent high schoolcompleters from 2010–19 compared with 45 percent in 1960 (see the National Center for Education Statistics web siteat https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_302.20.asp).

In contrast, 19 percent of adults whose par-ents did not attend college obtained a bachelor's degree.The type of institution attended also varied with parental education, race, and ethnicity. Mostadults who attended college went to public institutions (71 percent), while just less than one-fourth attended private nonprofit schools and 5 percent attended private for-profit schools.43Although for-profit schools comprised a relatively small share of the higher education attendancefor students of a range of backgrounds, adults whose parents did not attend college were some-what more likely to attend a for-profit institution than those who have a parent with a bachelor’sdegree—7 percent compared with 3 percent. Additionally, 12 percent of Black adults and 7 per-cent of Hispanic adults who went to college attended for-profit schools.44Overall Value of Higher EducationConsistent with higher rates of financial well-being among those who have more education dis-cussed in the “Overall Financial Well-Being” section of this report, just more than one-half ofadults who went to college said that the lifetime financial benefits of their higher educationexceeded the financial costs. Meanwhile, just above one-fifth said that the costs are higher. Therest saw the benefits as about the same as the costs. These self-assessments of the financialvalue of education have changed little in recent years.The self-assessed value of higher education, while generally positive, depends on several aspectsof a person’s educational experience. In particular, those who completed their program andreceived a degree were more likely to see net benefits than those who did not complete a degree.Among those who went to college but did not complete at least an associate degree, 30 percentsaid the benefits of their education exceeded the cost. This fraction jumped to 42 percent ofthose with an associate degree and 68 percent of those with at least a bachelor’s degree.In addition to varying by level of education, the self-assessed value of higher education also gener-ally increased with age. Among those who completed at least an associate degree, those who areage 45 and older had more positive assessments of the value of their education than those under
43Individuals do not self-report the type of institution in the survey. Instead, the institution type is assigned by matchingthe name and location of the college reported by the individual with data from the Center on Postsecondary Research atthe Indiana University School of Education (https://cpr.indiana.edu/). For individuals who completed an associate orbachelor’s degree, institution type is based on the school from which they received the degree. For other individuals, it isbased on the last school attended.44William R. Emmons and Lowell R. Rickets, “College Is Not Enough: Higher Education Does Not Eliminate Racial andEthnic Wealth Gaps,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review99, no. 1 (2017), 7–40 found significantly differentwealth outcomes between racial and ethnic groups within the same education level, which could not be explained byobservable characteristics such as age, family structure, financial decisionmaking, or luck. While likely not fullyexplaining the gap, one characteristic that could contribute to these differences in wealth returns to education acrossracial and ethnic groups is the type of school attended, since students’ outcomes vary significantly between for-profitschools and other colleges.

It may also be driven by therising costs of higher education and theincreased use of student loans, which makecosts remain more salient into adulthood.46Reflecting the potential importance of studentloans to perceptions of higher education,43 percent of adults with outstanding studentloans from their own education said the finan-cial benefits of their higher education exceeded the costs. By comparison, 53 percent of adultswho had completely paid off their student loans or who went to college but never had debt saidthe benefits of their education exceeded the cost.The type of institution attended also was related to differences in how people viewed their educa-tion. Fifty-three percent of those who attended public institutions and 58 percent of those whoattended private nonprofit institutions saw the financial benefits of their educational as greaterthan their costs. However, a far lower 31 percent of those who attended for-profit institutions felttheir education was worth the cost.Look Back on Education DecisionsAnother way to assess the financial value of education is to consider what people would havedone differently if given the chance. Most people valued the education they received, but with thebenefit of hindsight and life experience, it was also common to think that different educationaldecisions could have been better. This provides an additional way to explore how people’s viewson their educational investments relate to their current financial well-being.45A similar age profile is not observed for those who have not yet completed a degree, although this is because currentlyenrolled students who have not yet completed a degree generally have positive assessments of the value of their educa-tion. When restricting to those who are not enrolled, non-completers age 45 and older are more likely to say that theireducation produced net financial benefits than are younger non-completers (29 percent and 18 percent say the benefitsexceed the cost, respectively).46From 1995 to 2015, the average net tuition, fees, room, and board rose 54 percent at public four-year institutions and29 percent at private, nonprofit, four-year institutions. However, the average net tuition, fees, room, and board at bothpublic and nonprofit institutions declined from 2015 to 2022.

"Compare how age, degree type, and institution type shape views on college’s net financial value.",,"Age, degree type, and institution type each significantly influence perceptions of college’s net financial value:

- **Age:** Older adults, especially those 45 and older, are more likely to say the financial benefits of their education exceeded the costs compared to younger adults. This may be because older individuals have had more time to realize higher earnings and experience the long-term advantages of their degrees.

- **Degree Type:** Those who completed higher-level degrees were much more positive about the value of their education. Only 30% of non-completers said the benefits exceeded the costs, compared to 42% of associate degree holders and 68% of those with at least a bachelor’s degree.

- **Institution Type:** Perceptions also varied by where individuals attended college. A majority of graduates from public (53%) and private nonprofit institutions (58%) felt that the financial benefits outweighed the costs, but only 31% of those from for-profit institutions felt the same.

These self-assessments of the financialvalue of education have changed little in recent years.The self-assessed value of higher education, while generally positive, depends on several aspectsof a person’s educational experience. In particular, those who completed their program andreceived a degree were more likely to see net benefits than those who did not complete a degree.Among those who went to college but did not complete at least an associate degree, 30 percentsaid the benefits of their education exceeded the cost. This fraction jumped to 42 percent ofthose with an associate degree and 68 percent of those with at least a bachelor’s degree.In addition to varying by level of education, the self-assessed value of higher education also gener-ally increased with age. Among those who completed at least an associate degree, those who areage 45 and older had more positive assessments of the value of their education than those under
43Individuals do not self-report the type of institution in the survey. Instead, the institution type is assigned by matchingthe name and location of the college reported by the individual with data from the Center on Postsecondary Research atthe Indiana University School of Education (https://cpr.indiana.edu/). For individuals who completed an associate orbachelor’s degree, institution type is based on the school from which they received the degree. For other individuals, it isbased on the last school attended.44William R. Emmons and Lowell R. Rickets, “College Is Not Enough: Higher Education Does Not Eliminate Racial andEthnic Wealth Gaps,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Review99, no. 1 (2017), 7–40 found significantly differentwealth outcomes between racial and ethnic groups within the same education level, which could not be explained byobservable characteristics such as age, family structure, financial decisionmaking, or luck. While likely not fullyexplaining the gap, one characteristic that could contribute to these differences in wealth returns to education acrossracial and ethnic groups is the type of school attended, since students’ outcomes vary significantly between for-profitschools and other colleges.

"What are the main challenges in monetary policy transmission, inflation dynamics, and non-bank financial intermediation?",,"The main challenges are:

1. **Monetary Policy Transmission:** Transmission can be complicated by financial-market sentiment (Kashyap & Stein, 2023) and non-bank participation, making policy effects unpredictable (Hofmann & Peersman, 2017; Eren & Wooldridge, 2021).

2. **Inflation Dynamics:** Inflation is driven by complex factors including supply shocks (Avalos et al, 2022), commodity prices (Hofmann et al, 2023), and changing wage/contract structures (Christofides & Peng, 2006; Fregert & Jonung, 2008). High uncertainty makes reliable inflation indicators harder to identify (De Fiore et al, 2022).

3. **Non-Bank Financial Intermediation:** Growth in non-bank intermediaries creates systemic risks due to less regulation and greater opacity (FSB, 2020; Carstens, 2021). Non-banks can affect government bond markets and amplify financial vulnerabilities (Eren & Wooldridge, 2021; FSB, 2022).

In summary, evolving financial structures, heightened uncertainty, and increased non-bank roles complicate monetary policy effectiveness and inflation management.","38

Compare post-2021 research on global inflation persistence with studies on RT inflation indicator innovations.,,"Recent post-2021 research on global inflation persistence, such as Borio et al (2023), De Fiore et al (2022), and Mojon et al (2023), emphasizes the heightened uncertainty and potential regime shifts impacting the persistence of inflation globally. These studies highlight that traditional inflation dynamics may no longer hold, stressing the importance of structural factors and changing expectations that prolong inflation pressures.

In contrast, studies on real-time (RT) inflation indicator innovations, like Cavallo and Kryvtsov (2023), focus on new data sources (e.g., online micro data and stockouts) and methodologies to better track and signal inflation in real time. This research provides timely and granular insights into actual pricing and supply conditions, improving the accuracy and responsiveness of inflation monitoring compared to conventional indicators.

In summary, post-2021 research on inflation persistence deals with the underlying causes and durability of inflation, while RT indicator innovations center on measurement improvements for quicker and more precise inflation tracking. Both are responses to increased uncertainty but address different aspects—one structural, the other technological and methodological.","38

Analyze how sovereign currency mismatches amplify fiscal dominance risk during sudden exchange rate shocks.,,"Sovereign currency mismatches—when a government holds significant debt in foreign currency—amplify fiscal dominance risk during sudden exchange rate shocks by quickly increasing debt servicing costs. If the exchange rate depreciates sharply, as often occurs in emerging market economies (EMEs), the local-currency cost of repaying foreign-denominated debt surges. This can rapidly worsen fiscal positions, push countries toward their debt limits, and trigger rising risk premia and further depreciations (as shown in Graphs 13.B and 13.C). These dynamics constrain the central bank’s ability to tighten monetary policy, since higher interest rates could further destabilize public finances, leading to fiscal dominance where fiscal pressures override monetary policy goals. Thus, currency mismatches make economies more vulnerable to self-reinforcing vicious cycles of rising sovereign risk, weaker currencies, and policy constraints.","61

Beyond the impact of fiscal deficits on inflation, high levels of debt may also 
play a role by constraining the room for manoeuvre of monetary policy. The most 
acute concern is the risk of fiscal dominance, ie a situation in which monetary policy 
is unable to tighten due to fiscal constraints (see also Box A). 22 Fiscal dominance can 
arise for two reasons. In some cases, the central bank is subject to political economy

The first is the post‑GFC large‑scale government bond purchases implemented 
by several central banks. These purchases – which amounted to 25–50% of the 
outstanding stock in major AEs (Graph 5.B) – were financed with central bank reserves, 
thus shortening the maturity of the consolidated public debt. This implies that higher 
interest rates transmit much faster to public finances via reduced remittances from 
central banks. Indeed, after accounting for approximately 6% of interest payments 
on public debt in 2010–20, central bank transfers to governments in AEs have already 
declined to zero in most countries (Graph 11.A).
The second, much more general factor is the historically high levels of public 
debt, which means that higher interest rates can lead to a large increase in debt service 
costs. For example, should interest rates return to levels prevailing in the mid‑1990s, 
interest rate payments on public debt would, over time, surge above 6% of GDP – the 
highest level in the post‑World War II period (Graph 11.B).
Pressures on public debt would increase further should medium‑term growth prove 
disappointing. Global growth prospects are the weakest in decades owing to several 
structural forces, including geoeconomic fragmentation, slower labour force growth, 
and slowdowns in China and other EMEs. 18 In addition, risks to fiscal positions may 
themselves weaken economic prospects and raise the risk of adverse non‑linear effects. 
For example, high public debt may constrain the ability of fiscal policy to operate 
countercyclically during recessions. This could erode confidence in the economic 
outlook, thus reducing private investment and growth. In turn, weaker growth prospects 
may exacerbate fiscal risks, increasing risk premia and further undermining economic 
activity. Countries with higher public debt levels thus tend to experience shorter phases 
with interest rates lower than growth rates, as well as a higher probability of a reversal.19 
In EMEs, the potential for vicious circles between fiscal sustainability, slowing 
growth and rising interest rates is higher. One key reason is that exchange rate 
reactions can suddenly push countries to bump up against debt limits. Loss of 
confidence in debt sustainability can trigger sharp depreciations that, in the presence 
of currency mismatches, can wreak havoc on public and private balance sheets, 
leading to exploding debt service costs and severe recessions.

Inflation risks
Pressure on fiscal positions and sovereign risk may increase inflation risks going forward. 
In the near term, fiscal deficits remain large in many countries, thus sustaining 
aggregate demand and inflation. Hence, monetary and fiscal policy are at risk of 
working at cross purposes, complicating the fight against inflation (Chapter I). This 
heightens the risk of transitioning to a high‑inflation regime – a concern that 
becomes more acute the longer inflation remains elevated. 
Taking a long‑term perspective sheds further light on these risks. The evidence 
indicates that the inflationary effects of fiscal policy depend on the fiscal and 
monetary policy regime. In AEs, if fiscal policy is prudent – leaning against public 
debt increases through higher primary balances – and central banks are independent, 
fiscal stimulus has modest effects on inflation (Graph 12.A). 20 But if fiscal policy fails 
to stabilise debt (ie is profligate) and central bank independence is questioned, the 
inflationary effects of fiscal policy are much stronger. 
The effects of fiscal stimulus on inflation tend to be greater in EMEs (Graph 12.B). 
This is largely due to the role of the exchange rate. In AEs, fiscal stimulus tends to 
have no significant effect on the exchange rate. By contrast, fiscal expansions in 
EMEs trigger a significant depreciation of the exchange rate. 21  In turn, exchange 
rate depreciations feed into higher inflation, and to a larger extent than in AEs 
(Graph 13.A).
The transmission of fiscal stimulus to exchange rates in EMEs largely reflects 
concerns about sovereign risks. Fiscal expansions are associated with increases in 
sovereign risks, as captured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads (Graph 13.B). These  
increases, in turn, trigger depreciations (Graph 13.C). In this respect, exchange rates 
act as the proverbial canary in the coal mine, being highly responsive to the first signs 
of macroeconomic instability. Beyond feeding back into higher domestic prices and 
thus undermining efforts to contain inflation, exchange rate depreciations can also 
pose considerable financial stability concerns.

"How do persistent fiscal deficits, rising sovereign risk, and low MP independence together fuel inflation and FX depreciation in EMEs?",,"Persistent fiscal deficits in EMEs raise sovereign risk, as evidenced by rising CDS spreads. This heightened sovereign risk leads to significant exchange rate depreciations, which, due to stronger pass-through effects in EMEs, directly increase domestic inflation. When monetary policy (MP) independence is low, central banks are less able to counteract inflationary pressures from fiscal stimulus, further amplifying the inflation and currency depreciation. Thus, the combination of persistent deficits, higher perceived sovereign risk, and weak monetary independence creates a feedback loop that fuels both inflation and FX depreciation in EMEs.","61

"Examine non-linear feedback loops between sovereign default risk, FX volatility, and hyperinflation in EMEs.",,"In emerging market economies (EMEs), non-linear feedback loops can develop between sovereign default risk, FX (foreign exchange) volatility, and hyperinflation:

- Fiscal expansions increase sovereign risk, as indicated by rising credit default swap (CDS) spreads (Graph 13.B).
- Higher sovereign risk often causes rapid exchange rate depreciation (Graph 13.C), since investors lose confidence and move capital out of the country.
- FX depreciation sharply raises domestic prices, leading to higher inflation rates (Graph 13.A). If unchecked, this can escalate into hyperinflation, especially when currency mismatches exist in public or private balance sheets.
- Rising inflation erodes economic confidence further, possibly triggering additional fiscal stress (higher deficits and debt servicing costs), which reinforces sovereign risk.
- This loop can spiral: sovereign risk → FX depreciation → inflation → fiscal stress → more risk, making the situation unstable and non-linear, particularly in EMEs where exchange rates react quickly to signs of macroeconomic instability.

Thus, the interdependence between sovereign risk, FX volatility, and inflation in EMEs can create vicious circles, leading to severe macroeconomic crises.","61

The first is the post‑GFC large‑scale government bond purchases implemented 
by several central banks. These purchases – which amounted to 25–50% of the 
outstanding stock in major AEs (Graph 5.B) – were financed with central bank reserves, 
thus shortening the maturity of the consolidated public debt. This implies that higher 
interest rates transmit much faster to public finances via reduced remittances from 
central banks. Indeed, after accounting for approximately 6% of interest payments 
on public debt in 2010–20, central bank transfers to governments in AEs have already 
declined to zero in most countries (Graph 11.A).
The second, much more general factor is the historically high levels of public 
debt, which means that higher interest rates can lead to a large increase in debt service 
costs. For example, should interest rates return to levels prevailing in the mid‑1990s, 
interest rate payments on public debt would, over time, surge above 6% of GDP – the 
highest level in the post‑World War II period (Graph 11.B).
Pressures on public debt would increase further should medium‑term growth prove 
disappointing. Global growth prospects are the weakest in decades owing to several 
structural forces, including geoeconomic fragmentation, slower labour force growth, 
and slowdowns in China and other EMEs. 18 In addition, risks to fiscal positions may 
themselves weaken economic prospects and raise the risk of adverse non‑linear effects. 
For example, high public debt may constrain the ability of fiscal policy to operate 
countercyclically during recessions. This could erode confidence in the economic 
outlook, thus reducing private investment and growth. In turn, weaker growth prospects 
may exacerbate fiscal risks, increasing risk premia and further undermining economic 
activity. Countries with higher public debt levels thus tend to experience shorter phases 
with interest rates lower than growth rates, as well as a higher probability of a reversal.19 
In EMEs, the potential for vicious circles between fiscal sustainability, slowing 
growth and rising interest rates is higher. One key reason is that exchange rate 
reactions can suddenly push countries to bump up against debt limits. Loss of 
confidence in debt sustainability can trigger sharp depreciations that, in the presence 
of currency mismatches, can wreak havoc on public and private balance sheets, 
leading to exploding debt service costs and severe recessions.

Inflation risks
Pressure on fiscal positions and sovereign risk may increase inflation risks going forward. 
In the near term, fiscal deficits remain large in many countries, thus sustaining 
aggregate demand and inflation. Hence, monetary and fiscal policy are at risk of 
working at cross purposes, complicating the fight against inflation (Chapter I). This 
heightens the risk of transitioning to a high‑inflation regime – a concern that 
becomes more acute the longer inflation remains elevated. 
Taking a long‑term perspective sheds further light on these risks. The evidence 
indicates that the inflationary effects of fiscal policy depend on the fiscal and 
monetary policy regime. In AEs, if fiscal policy is prudent – leaning against public 
debt increases through higher primary balances – and central banks are independent, 
fiscal stimulus has modest effects on inflation (Graph 12.A). 20 But if fiscal policy fails 
to stabilise debt (ie is profligate) and central bank independence is questioned, the 
inflationary effects of fiscal policy are much stronger. 
The effects of fiscal stimulus on inflation tend to be greater in EMEs (Graph 12.B). 
This is largely due to the role of the exchange rate. In AEs, fiscal stimulus tends to 
have no significant effect on the exchange rate. By contrast, fiscal expansions in 
EMEs trigger a significant depreciation of the exchange rate. 21  In turn, exchange 
rate depreciations feed into higher inflation, and to a larger extent than in AEs 
(Graph 13.A).
The transmission of fiscal stimulus to exchange rates in EMEs largely reflects 
concerns about sovereign risks. Fiscal expansions are associated with increases in 
sovereign risks, as captured by credit default swap (CDS) spreads (Graph 13.B). These  
increases, in turn, trigger depreciations (Graph 13.C). In this respect, exchange rates 
act as the proverbial canary in the coal mine, being highly responsive to the first signs 
of macroeconomic instability. Beyond feeding back into higher domestic prices and 
thus undermining efforts to contain inflation, exchange rate depreciations can also 
pose considerable financial stability concerns.

"Analyze how unified ledgers with tokenised assets might transform cross-border interbank settlements’ speed, risk, and interoperability.",,"Unified ledgers with tokenised assets could dramatically improve cross-border interbank settlements by:

1. **Speed**: Unified ledgers allow for simultaneous and instantaneous settlement of transactions. By integrating central bank digital currencies, private tokenised monies, and assets on a single programmable platform, manual interventions and reconciliations are reduced, eliminating delays typically seen in cross-border settlements.

2. **Risk**: Settlement in central bank money within a unified ledger ensures payment finality and reduces credit and settlement risks. Atomic settlement capabilities mean that transfers of money and assets can occur at the same time, minimizing the risk that one party defaults before the other fulfills its obligations.

3. **Interoperability**: By operating as a “common venue” for various tokenised assets and monies, unified ledgers inherently support interoperability. Application programming interfaces (APIs) can connect different ledgers and legacy systems, creating a “network of networks” and mitigating the drawbacks of siloed systems. This encourages seamless integration across jurisdictions and platforms.

In summary, unified ledgers with tokenised assets offer the potential for faster, safer, and more interoperable cross-border interbank settlements, opening doors to new economic arrangements and enhancing the efficiency and resilience of the financial system.","94

programmable platform. Money in tokenised form provides the essential means of 
payment that mirror the underlying economic transactions. At the heart of the system 
lies central bank money in tokenised form that facilitates settlement finality. 
This section outlines the concept of a unified ledger where central bank digital 
currencies, private tokenised monies and other tokenised assets coexist on the same 
programmable platform. In simple terms, a unified ledger could be considered a 
“common venue” where money and other tokenised objects come together to enable 
seamless integration of transactions and to open the door to entirely new types of 
economic arrangement.
The concept of a unified ledger does not mean “one ledger to rule them all” – a 
sole ledger that overshadows all other systems in the economy. Depending on the 
needs of each jurisdiction, multiple ledgers, each with a specific use case, could 
coexist. APIs could connect these ledgers to each other and existing systems (Box B). 
Over time, they could incorporate new functions or merge as overlaps in scope 
expand. The scope of a unified ledger would also determine the parties involved in 
each ledger’s governance arrangements. 
While the creation of a unified ledger would require the introduction of a new 
type of financial market infrastructure (FMI), some of the envisaged benefits could 
Box B
Connecting ledgers through application programming interfaces
A unified ledger combines tokenised money and assets on a common platform. By doing so, it enables 
programmability, composability and multi-asset atomic settlement. On the road to a unified ledger, an 
intermediate solution would be to integrate legacy systems and existing infrastructures with new 
programmable platforms through application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs can interconnect systems 
and implement ramps that lock assets in traditional ledgers and unlock them in programmable platforms. If 
well designed, APIs may guarantee settlement finality as conventionally defined (CPSS-IOSCO (2012)). 
However, because APIs involve multiple systems with different operators and protocols, API implementations 
cannot achieve atomic settlement. Graph B1 shows three different models that range from the smallest 
incremental enhancement to a fully fledged unified ledger.
In the first model, an API connects the existing payment system to a programmable platform that 
contains only a limited number of asset classes (Graph B1.A). The programmable platform does not contain 
tokenised private monies or central bank digital currency (CBDC). Clearing and settlement of payments are 
achieved using traditional accounts at banks and via the conventional settlement system (eg a real-time gross 
settlement system). A set of APIs coordinate workflows by sending and receiving messages across systems. 
The operators from both systems establish the standards for APIs. Settlement finality is achieved in the usual 
way. However, in this model, atomic settlement involving transactions with private monies, central bank money 
and other assets would not be feasible.
In the second model (Graph B1.B), the programmable platform contains tokenised private monies and 
tokenised assets, and APIs connect these to the central bank’s settlement infrastructure.1 The platform contains 
no partition for the central bank. Tokenised private money partitions are connected to traditional systems 
through APIs and smart contracts. These contracts contain rules that ensure that the updating of accounts 
across participants is accompanied by settlement in central bank money in the traditional settlement system, 
which is triggered through APIs. This model guarantees atomic settlement for private monies and other assets, 
but not for transactions that involve CBDC. 
In the third model (Graph B1.C), wholesale CBDC, tokenised private monies and tokenised assets coexist 
on a fully fledged unified ledger.  Wholesale CBDCs could be provided in two ways. In the first, CBDCs may 
take the form of a central bank liability that is issued directly on to the unified ledger. Alternatively, the central 
bank could tokenise existing reserves using an API that connects the unified ledger to the current reserve 
system. This system supports settlement finality and atomic settlement for transactions involving wholesale 
CBDC, private tokenised monies and tokenised assets.
 
1 The latter approach is being adopted in the Brazilian Digital Real pilot project (Central Bank of Brazil (2023)).|87
BIS Annual Economic Report 2023
A unified ledger transforms the way that intermediaries interact to serve end 
users. Through programmability and the platform’s ability to bundle transactions 
(“composability”), a unified ledger allows sequences of financial transactions to be 
automated and seamlessly integrated. This reduces the need for manual interventions 
and reconciliations that arise from the traditional separation of messaging, clearing 
and settlement, thereby eliminating delays and uncertainty. The ledger also supports 
simultaneous and instantaneous settlement, reducing settlement times and credit 
risks. Settlement in central bank money ensures the singleness of money and 
payment finality. 
Moreover, by having “everything in one place”, a unified ledger provides a setting 
in which a broader array of contingent actions can be automatically executed to 
overcome information and incentive problems. In this way, tokenisation could expand 
the universe of possible contracting outcomes. The unified ledger thus opens the way 
for entirely new types of economic arrangement that are impossible today due to 
incentive and informational frictions. The eventual transformation of the financial 
system will be limited only by the imagination and ingenuity of developers that build 
on the system, much as the ecosystem of smartphone apps has far exceeded the 
expectations of the platform builders themselves. Even in the near term, a unified 
ledger could unlock arrangements that have clear economic rationale. Possibilities 
include new types of deposit contract that bolster financial stability, improvements in 
supply chain finance and new ways to improve the financial system’s resilience and 
integrity.
The unified ledger concept can be broad or narrow, with the first instances likely 
to be application-specific in scope. For example, one ledger could aim at improving 
securities settlement, while another could facilitate trade finance in supply chains. 
Tokenised forms of money would figure in each ledger to provide the transaction 
medium. Each unified ledger would bring together only the intermediaries and assets 
required for each application. The scope of a ledger will also determine the relevant 
players that must be involved in the governance arrangements. Separate ledgers 
could be connected through application programming interfaces (APIs), or, as their 
scope expands over time, they could incorporate additional assets and entities, or 
merge together. 
Some of the benefits envisaged from the unified ledger could be reaped by 
interlinking existing systems through APIs into a “network of networks”. While such a 
network of networks would still consist of separate systems and fall short of fully 
fledged programmability across systems, the worst drawbacks of siloed systems 
could be mitigated. 
This next stage in the financial system’s journey will be one that combines the 
best efforts of both the private and public sectors. Central banks could work with 
regulated private entities to develop technological solutions and standards to meet 
specific use cases. With their public interest mandate, central banks are best placed 
to establish a common venue for each use case by interlinking with the monetary 
system. Proper oversight and supervision will be a prerequisite for this endeavour.
In embracing evolution and change, central banks and the private sector should 
follow key guiding principles to ensure that the monetary system harnesses innovation 
for the public interest. First, the tried and tested division of roles between the public 
and private sector in the two-tiered system remains the cornerstone. The second 
principle is upholding a competitive level playing field that promotes innovation and 
financial inclusion. And third, the future monetary system needs to meet the highest 
standards of data security and privacy, while ensuring system integrity by guarding 
against illicit activity such as money laundering, financing of terrorism and fraud.
The rest of the chapter introduces the concept of tokenisation and how it could 
be mobilised in the design of key elements of the future monetary system: central|96

also be reaped through more incremental changes to existing systems and 
interlinking them through APIs into a network of networks.  Weighing the pros and 
cons of a big leap against those of a series of incremental changes is important when 
considering innovation of any kind but it is especially important for the large discrete 
changes entailed by new infrastructures such as a unified ledger. Some automated 
processes for exchanging data that resemble operations in tokenised environments 
could be achieved by connecting existing systems through APIs. In the short term, 
modifying existing systems would require lower upfront costs and less coordination 
among stakeholders than creating a unified ledger.
Yet history shows that incremental fixes have their limits, especially when they 
accumulate on top of legacy systems. Each new layer would need to look forwards 
while being constrained by having to look backwards to ensure compatibility with 
legacy systems. These constraints will become more binding as more layers are added 
on top, eventually holding back innovative developments. The history of computing 
and software is replete with such examples.14
For these reasons, it is often the case that harnessing the benefits of technological 
advances necessitates a fundamental rethink of the financial infrastructure that 
supports new types of operation. Tokenisation presents another such opportunity, 
where the introduction of programmable platforms could bring long-term benefits 
that far outweigh the short-term costs arising from investment as well as the costs 
and coordination efforts in shifting to new standards and procedures. Of course, the 
relative balance between the benefits of a unified ledger and those from interlinking 
existing systems through APIs will depend on the state of technology and the specific 
needs of each jurisdiction. There is no one size fits all.
The building blocks of a unified ledger
A unified ledger leverages the benefits of tokenisation on a common platform. Based 
on a secure environment for storing and sharing data through encryption, it could 
enable new forms of transaction, thus expanding the universe of contracting outcomes. 
There are two key aspects to the design of a unified ledger. The first is that it 
combines all the components needed to complete a transaction on one platform, 
ie it has everything in one place. The second is that it features money and assets as 
executable objects, which means they could be transferred safely and securely 
without going through external authentication and verification processes and without 
relying on external messaging systems.
The structure of a unified ledger can be described in terms of the following 
building blocks (Graph 5). The ledger comprises a data environment and an 
execution environment, which are subject to a common governance framework. The 
data environment contains the digital representations of money and assets in 
separate partitions that are owned and operated by the respective competent 
operating entities (dashed lines). The data environment also includes information 
necessary for the operation of the ledger, such as the data required for the secure 
and legal transfer of money and assets. The data environment also encompasses all 
information necessary to incorporate real-world events into any contingent 
performance of actions. Information can be a direct result of transactions on the 
ledger or may be obtained from the outside environment.15 
Any operation involving one or more of these elements is carried out in the 
execution environment, either directly by users or through smart contracts. For each 
specific application, operations in the execution environment combine only the 
intermediaries and assets required for each application. For example, a payment 
between two individuals, executed via a smart contract, would bring together the 
users’ banks (as providers of tokenised deposits) and the central bank (as provider",./dataset_2/pt2\ar2023e.pdf
How do APIs connect legacy FMIs to programmable platforms for asset tokenisation and settlement finality?,,"APIs connect legacy financial market infrastructures (FMIs) to programmable platforms by acting as bridges that enable communication and coordination between traditional systems and new tokenised environments. Specifically, APIs can lock assets in traditional ledgers and unlock them as tokenised representations on programmable platforms. This integration allows legacy systems to participate in workflows involving asset tokenisation and payment settlement.

While APIs can guarantee settlement finality as conventionally defined, they cannot support atomic settlement (simultaneous, instant exchange of assets) across multiple systems due to the involvement of different operators and protocols. Thus, APIs offer incremental improvements by enabling interconnection and coordination, but full programmability and atomic settlement are only achieved in a fully unified ledger where all components coexist on one platform.","94

combines all the components needed to complete a transaction on one platform, 
ie it has everything in one place. The second is that it features money and assets as 
executable objects, which means they could be transferred safely and securely 
without going through external authentication and verification processes and without 
relying on external messaging systems.
The structure of a unified ledger can be described in terms of the following 
building blocks (Graph 5). The ledger comprises a data environment and an 
execution environment, which are subject to a common governance framework. The 
data environment contains the digital representations of money and assets in 
separate partitions that are owned and operated by the respective competent 
operating entities (dashed lines). The data environment also includes information 
necessary for the operation of the ledger, such as the data required for the secure 
and legal transfer of money and assets. The data environment also encompasses all 
information necessary to incorporate real-world events into any contingent 
performance of actions. Information can be a direct result of transactions on the 
ledger or may be obtained from the outside environment.15 
Any operation involving one or more of these elements is carried out in the 
execution environment, either directly by users or through smart contracts. For each 
specific application, operations in the execution environment combine only the 
intermediaries and assets required for each application. For example, a payment 
between two individuals, executed via a smart contract, would bring together the 
users’ banks (as providers of tokenised deposits) and the central bank (as provider",./dataset_2/pt2\ar2023e.pdf
Evaluate the implications of direct unified ledger deployment vs. gradual adoption via cross-ledger programmability.,,"Direct deployment of a unified ledger offers transformative benefits by consolidating money and assets on a single programmable platform, enabling atomic settlement, seamless automation, and expanded contracting possibilities that eliminate informational and incentive frictions. This “everything in one place” approach can unlock fundamentally new economic arrangements and efficiencies, such as instantaneous settlement and reduced operational risks, but it entails significant upfront investment, complex coordination, and the need to redesign financial infrastructure and governance.

In contrast, gradual adoption through cross-ledger programmability—using APIs to interconnect legacy systems and new platforms—provides incremental improvements at lower cost and with less disruption. This approach can realize some interoperability and process automation benefits, mitigate the worst drawbacks of siloed systems, and allow adaptation to specific jurisdictional needs. However, it cannot fully achieve the seamless programmability, atomic settlement, or compounding efficiencies of a unified ledger, and as more layers are added, accumulated complexity and backward compatibility may ultimately stifle further innovation.

Therefore, while incremental approaches allow manageable progress and risk, history suggests transformative gains from tokenisation and programmability will ultimately require the fundamental rethink that direct unified ledger deployment offers. The optimal path depends on local technological maturity, needs, and the balance of short-term costs versus long-term benefits.","94

programmable platform. Money in tokenised form provides the essential means of 
payment that mirror the underlying economic transactions. At the heart of the system 
lies central bank money in tokenised form that facilitates settlement finality. 
This section outlines the concept of a unified ledger where central bank digital 
currencies, private tokenised monies and other tokenised assets coexist on the same 
programmable platform. In simple terms, a unified ledger could be considered a 
“common venue” where money and other tokenised objects come together to enable 
seamless integration of transactions and to open the door to entirely new types of 
economic arrangement.
The concept of a unified ledger does not mean “one ledger to rule them all” – a 
sole ledger that overshadows all other systems in the economy. Depending on the 
needs of each jurisdiction, multiple ledgers, each with a specific use case, could 
coexist. APIs could connect these ledgers to each other and existing systems (Box B). 
Over time, they could incorporate new functions or merge as overlaps in scope 
expand. The scope of a unified ledger would also determine the parties involved in 
each ledger’s governance arrangements. 
While the creation of a unified ledger would require the introduction of a new 
type of financial market infrastructure (FMI), some of the envisaged benefits could 
Box B
Connecting ledgers through application programming interfaces
A unified ledger combines tokenised money and assets on a common platform. By doing so, it enables 
programmability, composability and multi-asset atomic settlement. On the road to a unified ledger, an 
intermediate solution would be to integrate legacy systems and existing infrastructures with new 
programmable platforms through application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs can interconnect systems 
and implement ramps that lock assets in traditional ledgers and unlock them in programmable platforms. If 
well designed, APIs may guarantee settlement finality as conventionally defined (CPSS-IOSCO (2012)). 
However, because APIs involve multiple systems with different operators and protocols, API implementations 
cannot achieve atomic settlement. Graph B1 shows three different models that range from the smallest 
incremental enhancement to a fully fledged unified ledger.
In the first model, an API connects the existing payment system to a programmable platform that 
contains only a limited number of asset classes (Graph B1.A). The programmable platform does not contain 
tokenised private monies or central bank digital currency (CBDC). Clearing and settlement of payments are 
achieved using traditional accounts at banks and via the conventional settlement system (eg a real-time gross 
settlement system). A set of APIs coordinate workflows by sending and receiving messages across systems. 
The operators from both systems establish the standards for APIs. Settlement finality is achieved in the usual 
way. However, in this model, atomic settlement involving transactions with private monies, central bank money 
and other assets would not be feasible.
In the second model (Graph B1.B), the programmable platform contains tokenised private monies and 
tokenised assets, and APIs connect these to the central bank’s settlement infrastructure.1 The platform contains 
no partition for the central bank. Tokenised private money partitions are connected to traditional systems 
through APIs and smart contracts. These contracts contain rules that ensure that the updating of accounts 
across participants is accompanied by settlement in central bank money in the traditional settlement system, 
which is triggered through APIs. This model guarantees atomic settlement for private monies and other assets, 
but not for transactions that involve CBDC. 
In the third model (Graph B1.C), wholesale CBDC, tokenised private monies and tokenised assets coexist 
on a fully fledged unified ledger.  Wholesale CBDCs could be provided in two ways. In the first, CBDCs may 
take the form of a central bank liability that is issued directly on to the unified ledger. Alternatively, the central 
bank could tokenise existing reserves using an API that connects the unified ledger to the current reserve 
system. This system supports settlement finality and atomic settlement for transactions involving wholesale 
CBDC, private tokenised monies and tokenised assets.
 
1 The latter approach is being adopted in the Brazilian Digital Real pilot project (Central Bank of Brazil (2023)).|87
BIS Annual Economic Report 2023
A unified ledger transforms the way that intermediaries interact to serve end 
users. Through programmability and the platform’s ability to bundle transactions 
(“composability”), a unified ledger allows sequences of financial transactions to be 
automated and seamlessly integrated. This reduces the need for manual interventions 
and reconciliations that arise from the traditional separation of messaging, clearing 
and settlement, thereby eliminating delays and uncertainty. The ledger also supports 
simultaneous and instantaneous settlement, reducing settlement times and credit 
risks. Settlement in central bank money ensures the singleness of money and 
payment finality. 
Moreover, by having “everything in one place”, a unified ledger provides a setting 
in which a broader array of contingent actions can be automatically executed to 
overcome information and incentive problems. In this way, tokenisation could expand 
the universe of possible contracting outcomes. The unified ledger thus opens the way 
for entirely new types of economic arrangement that are impossible today due to 
incentive and informational frictions. The eventual transformation of the financial 
system will be limited only by the imagination and ingenuity of developers that build 
on the system, much as the ecosystem of smartphone apps has far exceeded the 
expectations of the platform builders themselves. Even in the near term, a unified 
ledger could unlock arrangements that have clear economic rationale. Possibilities 
include new types of deposit contract that bolster financial stability, improvements in 
supply chain finance and new ways to improve the financial system’s resilience and 
integrity.
The unified ledger concept can be broad or narrow, with the first instances likely 
to be application-specific in scope. For example, one ledger could aim at improving 
securities settlement, while another could facilitate trade finance in supply chains. 
Tokenised forms of money would figure in each ledger to provide the transaction 
medium. Each unified ledger would bring together only the intermediaries and assets 
required for each application. The scope of a ledger will also determine the relevant 
players that must be involved in the governance arrangements. Separate ledgers 
could be connected through application programming interfaces (APIs), or, as their 
scope expands over time, they could incorporate additional assets and entities, or 
merge together. 
Some of the benefits envisaged from the unified ledger could be reaped by 
interlinking existing systems through APIs into a “network of networks”. While such a 
network of networks would still consist of separate systems and fall short of fully 
fledged programmability across systems, the worst drawbacks of siloed systems 
could be mitigated. 
This next stage in the financial system’s journey will be one that combines the 
best efforts of both the private and public sectors. Central banks could work with 
regulated private entities to develop technological solutions and standards to meet 
specific use cases. With their public interest mandate, central banks are best placed 
to establish a common venue for each use case by interlinking with the monetary 
system. Proper oversight and supervision will be a prerequisite for this endeavour.
In embracing evolution and change, central banks and the private sector should 
follow key guiding principles to ensure that the monetary system harnesses innovation 
for the public interest. First, the tried and tested division of roles between the public 
and private sector in the two-tiered system remains the cornerstone. The second 
principle is upholding a competitive level playing field that promotes innovation and 
financial inclusion. And third, the future monetary system needs to meet the highest 
standards of data security and privacy, while ensuring system integrity by guarding 
against illicit activity such as money laundering, financing of terrorism and fraud.
The rest of the chapter introduces the concept of tokenisation and how it could 
be mobilised in the design of key elements of the future monetary system: central|96
BIS Annual Economic Report 2023
also be reaped through more incremental changes to existing systems and 
interlinking them through APIs into a network of networks.  Weighing the pros and 
cons of a big leap against those of a series of incremental changes is important when 
considering innovation of any kind but it is especially important for the large discrete 
changes entailed by new infrastructures such as a unified ledger. Some automated 
processes for exchanging data that resemble operations in tokenised environments 
could be achieved by connecting existing systems through APIs. In the short term, 
modifying existing systems would require lower upfront costs and less coordination 
among stakeholders than creating a unified ledger.
Yet history shows that incremental fixes have their limits, especially when they 
accumulate on top of legacy systems. Each new layer would need to look forwards 
while being constrained by having to look backwards to ensure compatibility with 
legacy systems. These constraints will become more binding as more layers are added 
on top, eventually holding back innovative developments. The history of computing 
and software is replete with such examples.14
For these reasons, it is often the case that harnessing the benefits of technological 
advances necessitates a fundamental rethink of the financial infrastructure that 
supports new types of operation. Tokenisation presents another such opportunity, 
where the introduction of programmable platforms could bring long-term benefits 
that far outweigh the short-term costs arising from investment as well as the costs 
and coordination efforts in shifting to new standards and procedures. Of course, the 
relative balance between the benefits of a unified ledger and those from interlinking 
existing systems through APIs will depend on the state of technology and the specific 
needs of each jurisdiction. There is no one size fits all.
The building blocks of a unified ledger
A unified ledger leverages the benefits of tokenisation on a common platform. Based 
on a secure environment for storing and sharing data through encryption, it could 
enable new forms of transaction, thus expanding the universe of contracting outcomes. 
There are two key aspects to the design of a unified ledger. The first is that it 
combines all the components needed to complete a transaction on one platform, 
ie it has everything in one place. The second is that it features money and assets as

without going through external authentication and verification processes and without

Key Events 
Innovations and product approvals 
In March, we announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted our application 
and granted Priority Review designation for finereno ne (brand name Kerendia™) for the treatment of 
adult patients with heart failure with a left ventri cular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥40%. Marketing  
authorization applications for this indication were submitted in the United States and China in January, 
and in the European Union and Japan in February. These submissions were based on the positive  
results from the Phase III FINEARTS-HF study. 
In April, we filed an application for a third indication of aflibercept 8 mg (brand name Eylea™ 8 mg) with 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Based on positive results from the global Phase III QUASAR 
study, we submitted an application seeking approval of aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of patients 
with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. 
Efficiency measures in the Crop Science Division 
In May, we decided to reorganize the Crop Science Division’s activities in the areas of crop protection 
production and research and development in Germany. As a result of the changes, the division will 
discontinue its activities in Frankfur t am Main after the end of 2028. We aim to sell pa rts of the activities, 
while others will be relocated. Production at the Dormagen site will be streamlined to ensure its 
competitiveness for the future.

(Q1 2024: €525 million). Sales in Germany amou nted to €791 million (Q 1 2024: €729 million). 
Sales at Crop Science were down year on year, primar ily due to regulatory impacts in the United States 
and Europe as well as volume phasing into the second quarter. Sales at Pharmaceuticals increased, 
mainly driven by significant gains for Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™. We also registered continued sales 
growth for Eylea™ and our Radiology business, as well as strong performance in our contraceptives 
business. These positive effects were partially offset by Xarelto™ sales declining as expected. 
Consumer Health likewise registered an increase in sales, with growth largely driven by the Digestive 
Health category. 
EBITDA before special items 
Group EBITDA before special items decreased by 7.4% to €4,085 million. This figure included a negative 
currency effect of €165 million (Q1 2024: €206 million). Across all divisions, the change in sales was the main 
driver behind EBITDA before special items performance in the first quarter. At Crop Science, EBITDA before 
special items was held back by the decline in sales due to regulatory impacts. By contrast, Pharmaceuticals 
and Consumer Health both saw an increase in EBITDA before special items that was largely driven by sales 
gains. In the Reconciliation, EBITDA before special items was down, largely due to higher expenses for the 
Group-wide long-term incentive (LTI) program, as well as negative currency effects arising from hyperinflationary 
impacts. The Group EBITDA margin before special items came in at 29.7%.

Earnings 
EBITDA before special items at Pharmaceuticals advanced by  12.4% to €1,342 million (Q1 2024: 
€1,194 million) in the first quarter of 2025, main ly thanks to the increase in sales. Earnings also  
benefited from cost savings generated by our efficiency programs. These effects more than offset  
the impact of higher investments in early-stage research and in our cell and gene therapy and chemo-
proteomics technologies, as well  as a negative currency effect of €48 million (Q1 2024: €127 million). 
The EBITDA margin before special items therefore rose  by a significant 2.1 perc entage points to 29.5%. 
EBIT came in at €989 million in the first quarter of  2025 (Q1 2024: €872 million) after net special charges 
of €114 million (Q1 2024: €96 million)  that mainly related to ongoing restructur ing projects and the 
measurement of contingent considerations at fair value.

Key Events 
Innovations and product approvals 
In March, we announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had accepted our application 
and granted Priority Review designation for finereno ne (brand name Kerendia™) for the treatment of 
adult patients with heart failure with a left ventri cular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥40%. Marketing  
authorization applications for this indication were submitted in the United States and China in January, 
and in the European Union and Japan in February. These submissions were based on the positive  
results from the Phase III FINEARTS-HF study. 
In April, we filed an application for a third indication of aflibercept 8 mg (brand name Eylea™ 8 mg) with 
the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Based on positive results from the global Phase III QUASAR 
study, we submitted an application seeking approval of aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of patients 
with macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. 
Efficiency measures in the Crop Science Division 
In May, we decided to reorganize the Crop Science Division’s activities in the areas of crop protection 
production and research and development in Germany. As a result of the changes, the division will 
discontinue its activities in Frankfur t am Main after the end of 2028. We aim to sell pa rts of the activities, 
while others will be relocated. Production at the Dormagen site will be streamlined to ensure its 
competitiveness for the future.  
Earnings Performance of the Bayer Group1 
First quarter of 2025 
Group sales 
Group sales came in at €13,738 million in the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2024: €13,765 million;  
Fx & portfolio adj.: –0.1%; repo rted: –0.2%). There was a negative  currency effect of €55 million 
(Q1 2024: €525 million). Sales in Germany amou nted to €791 million (Q 1 2024: €729 million). 
Sales at Crop Science were down year on year, primar ily due to regulatory impacts in the United States 
and Europe as well as volume phasing into the second quarter. Sales at Pharmaceuticals increased, 
mainly driven by significant gains for Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™. We also registered continued sales 
growth for Eylea™ and our Radiology business, as well as strong performance in our contraceptives 
business. These positive effects were partially offset by Xarelto™ sales declining as expected. 
Consumer Health likewise registered an increase in sales, with growth largely driven by the Digestive 
Health category. 
EBITDA before special items 
Group EBITDA before special items decreased by 7.4% to €4,085 million. This figure included a negative 
currency effect of €165 million (Q1 2024: €206 million). Across all divisions, the change in sales was the main 
driver behind EBITDA before special items performance in the first quarter. At Crop Science, EBITDA before 
special items was held back by the decline in sales due to regulatory impacts. By contrast, Pharmaceuticals 
and Consumer Health both saw an increase in EBITDA before special items that was largely driven by sales 
gains. In the Reconciliation, EBITDA before special items was down, largely due to higher expenses for the 
Group-wide long-term incentive (LTI) program, as well as negative currency effects arising from hyperinflationary 
impacts. The Group EBITDA margin before special items came in at 29.7%.

"Compare the effects of sales growth, efficiency gains, and currency impact on Pharma vs. Group EBITDA.",,"In the first quarter of 2025, Pharmaceuticals’ EBITDA before special items rose by 12.4% to €1,342 million, mainly due to sales growth (driven by products like Nubeqa™, Kerendia™, and Eylea™) and efficiency program cost savings, which more than offset higher investment in R&D and a negative currency effect of €48 million (much lower than Q1 2024’s €127 million). In contrast, Group EBITDA before special items decreased by 7.4% to €4,085 million, as gains in Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health were outweighed by a decline in Crop Science and a negative overall currency effect of €165 million (Q1 2024: €206 million). Therefore, sales growth and efficiency gains had a clearly positive impact on Pharma EBITDA, outpacing negative currency effects, while for the Group, declining sales in key segments and larger currency headwinds led to an overall EBITDA decrease.","Bayer Quarterly Statement as of March 31, 2025  8

First quarter of 2025 
Sales 
In the Pharmaceuticals Division, we increased sales by 4.1% (Fx & portfo lio adj.) to €4, 548 million in the 
first quarter of 2025. We re gistered significant gains for our new products Nubeqa™ and Kerendia™, and 
also posted continued sales growth for Eylea™ and our Radiology business. In addition, the Mirena™ and 
YAZ™ families of contraceptive products showed st rong sales growth. By contrast, business headwinds 
mainly related to declin es for Xarelto™ due to patent expirations.  
// Sales of our ophthalmology drug 
Eylea™ continued to grow thanks to higher volumes. Business was 
primarily up in Europe, with significant gains in France, and Japan. Sales in these countries benefited 
in particular from the market launch of Eylea™  8 mg offering extended  treatment intervals. 
// As expected, sales of our oral anticoagulant 
Xarelto™ decreased markedly as a result of competitive 
pressure from generics, especially in Europe and Japan. License revenues – recognized as sales – in 
the United States, where Xarelto™ is marketed by a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, were up 
against the prior-year quarter.  
// Sales of our cancer drug 
Nubeqa™ rose significantly, with gains in all regions. The product therefore 
maintained its growth momentum, especially in the United States and Europe, with strong increases 
in volumes. 
// We also achieved considerable gains for 
Kerendia™, our product for the treatment of patients with 
chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, mainly thanks to a substantial rise in volumes 
in the United States and China. 
// Sales of our long-term contraceptives in the Mirena™ product family likewise increased by a double-digit 
percentage, mainly driven by growth in the United States. 
// We also registered further gains fo r our oral contraceptives in the YA Z ™ product family, especially 
in China.|Bayer Quarterly Statement as of March 31, 2025  9
// Business with our pulmonar y hypertension treatment Adempas™ showed encouraging growth, 
especially in the United States. As in the past, sales reflected the proportionate recognition of the 
upfront and milestone payments resulting from the sG C collaboration with Merck & Co., United States. 
// We recorded strong gains for 
Aspirin™ Cardio, for the secondary prevention of heart attacks, and 
Adalat™, for the treatment of hypertension and coronary heart disease, with growth primarily driven 
by China. 
// Sales of our Kovaltry™/Jivi™ blood-clotting medicines declined as a result of competitive pressure, 
with business mainly down in the United States. 
// Our Radiology business, which includes products such as Ultravist™ and CT Fluid Delivery, continued 
to post strong gains that were largely fueled by volume growth.

Analyze the impact of Asia/Pacific sales surge on Bayer’s core EPS contraction in Q1 2025.,,"Despite strong sales growth in Asia/Pacific (+8.6% reported, +7.5% currency- and portfolio-adjusted), Bayer’s core earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations fell by 11.7% in Q1 2025 (€2.49 vs. €2.82 in Q1 2024). The sales surge in Asia/Pacific was not enough to offset declines or flat performance in other regions (notably a significant drop in Latin America and modest growth/declines elsewhere), overall flat total group sales (–0.2%), increased costs (higher cost of goods sold and R&D), greater special charges, and higher other operating expenses. These factors contributed to lower EBIT and net income, outweighing regional growth and resulting in the contraction of core EPS.","Bayer Quarterly Statement as of March 31, 2025  14

Personnel expenses and employee numbers 
The number of employees in the Bayer Group as of th e closing date fell by 7. 4% year on year to 90,885 
(March 31, 2024: 98,189). Personnel expenses declined by 0.4% to €3 ,027 million in th e first quarter 
(Q1 2024: €3,040 million), with savings offset by expenses for the Grou p-wide long-term incentive (LTI) 
program as well as expens es relating to our restructuring prog rams, which remained at an elevated 
level.",./dataset_2/pt2\bayer-quarterly-statement-q1-2025.pdf
"How do restructuring, LTI program, and personnel expenses compare in affecting Bayer's FTE and total costs?",,"Restructuring programs and the Group-wide long-term incentive (LTI) program both contributed to Bayer’s personnel expenses remaining at an elevated level in Q1 2025. However, the overall number of employees (FTEs) decreased by 7.4% year-on-year (from 98,189 to 90,885), resulting in only a slight decline in personnel expenses (down 0.4% to €3,027 million). This suggests that while headcount reductions lowered costs, the savings were partly offset by ongoing restructuring expenses and LTI program costs, which kept total personnel expenses nearly flat.","Bayer Quarterly Statement as of March 31, 2025  14

Saudi Aramco I First quarter interim report 2025
Financial performance
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flows are primarily driven 
by market prices and volumes sold of hydrocarbons as well as 
refined and chemicals products.
Shareholders’ returns
• During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the 
79.3 billion ($21.14 billion). 
In addition, the Company distributed performance-linked 
0.8 billion ($0.22 billion). These dividend 
80.1 billion ($21.36 billion), reflect 
Aramco’s commitment to deliver value and share the upside of 
its financial performance with shareholders.
Investment in affiliates
• In January, Aramco completed the acquisition of a 50% equity 
interest in BHIG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of APQ. Following 
the initial investment in January, a subsequent investment was 
0.9 billion 
($0.24 billion). The transaction resulted in a reduction in cash 
and cash equivalents, and a corresponding increase in 
investments in joint ventures and associates.
• In relation to the definitive agreement signed in August 2024 to 
acquire additional shares of Petro Rabigh, Aramco and 
Sumitomo Chemical completed the waiver of the remaining 
amounts in January of their respective shareholder loans to 
0.9 billion ($0.24 billion) each. As a result, 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion), and recorded an addition to its equity 
investment in Petro Rabigh. This resulted in a decrease in 
non-current other assets and receivables, and a corresponding 
increase in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Portfolio optimization
• In February, SABIC completed the sale of its 20.62% 
3.6 billion 
($0.96 billion). As part of the transfer, the carrying amount of 
3.3 billion ($0.88 billion) was 
derecognized. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding decrease in assets classified as 
held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financing arrangements
• In March, SATORP, a joint operation of Aramco, entered into an 
asset transfer transaction with BHIG for upfront cash proceeds of 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion). As part of the transaction, SATORP 
transferred the ownership of a hydrogen manufacturing plant 
to BHIG and concurrently entered into a long-term hydrogen 
offtake agreement. This transaction, accounted for as a 
financing arrangement, resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.
• 2.0 billion 
($0.53 billion) related to the financing arrangement with JIGPC, 
which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents, and 
a corresponding increase in borrowings during the period.
• In March, Aramco extended the maturity date of its Sukuk 
11.3 billion ($3.0 billion). 
The Sukuk, with a maturity date of April 10, 2025, was extended 
to April 10, 2032 with an option to redeem early on October 10, 
2031. This resulted in a reclassification of the Sukuk balance 
from current to non-current borrowings.
• In March, SABIC refinanced a portion of its Murabaha loans, 
8.1 billion ($2.16 
billion), which will be repayable in instalments over a period of 
10 years. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.

reconciliations and definitions section.

the three-month period ended December 31, 2024 (Q4).

2025, despite global economic uncertainty. A disciplined approach to capital management ensures our 
long-term strategy remains on track, and our ongoing investment program continues to reinforce our 
core business and unlock strategic growth opportunities. Our focus remains on leveraging our strong 
competitive advantages to maximize our shareholders’ returns.”

Saudi Aramco I First quarter interim report 2025
Q1 2025 vs Q1 2024
Earnings before interest, income taxes and zakat for the first 
4,615 ($1,231) 
for the same quarter in 2024. This decrease was primarily 
attributed to weakening refining and chemical margins, inventory 
valuation movement, and certain other non-cash adjustments.
Capital expenditures8,607 
6,882 ($1,835) for 
the same quarter in 2024, predominantly due to the steady and 
on-track progress of capital projects such as the construction 
of the refinery-integrated petrochemical steam cracker being 
developed by S-OIL, the Amiral expansion at the SATORP refinery, 
and other projects.
Q1 2025 vs Q4 2024
Earnings before interest, income taxes and zakat for the first 
1,905 ($508) compared to a loss of  
7,957 ($2,122) for the fourth quarter of 2024. This increase 
was predominantly driven by an absence of impairment charges 
recorded in the previous quarter and inventory valuation 
movement, partially offset by weakening refining and chemical 
margins, and certain other non-cash adjustments.
Capital expenditures8,607 
15,148 ($4,039) for 
the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily due to phasing of capital 
spending.

"Compare Q1 2025 vs Q4 2024 and Q1 2024 in Aramco’s net income, capex, FCF, dividends, margins.",,"In Q1 2025, Aramco’s net income was $26.0 billion, up from $22.3 billion in Q4 2024 but down from $27.3 billion in Q1 2024. Capital expenditures (capex) were $12.5 billion, lower than Q4 2024’s $14.2 billion and higher than Q1 2024’s $10.8 billion. Free cash flow (FCF) came in at $19.2 billion, a decline from both Q4 2024 ($21.6 billion) and Q1 2024 ($22.8 billion).

Dividends for Q1 2025 included a base dividend of $21.1 billion (up 4.2% year-on-year) and a performance-linked dividend of $0.2 billion, totaling $21.3 billion—higher than Q4 2024 ($20.3B base + $10.8B perf-link, recognizing quarterly variability) but slightly above Q1 2024’s $20.3B base + $10.8B perf-link due to changes in distribution timing.

Margins were pressured: earnings before interest, income taxes, and zakat in the downstream segment rose to $0.5 billion in Q1 2025 from a loss of ($2.1 billion) in Q4 2024, but were down versus $1.2 billion in Q1 2024, mainly due to weakening refining and chemical margins and inventory effects.

In summary: Q1 2025 saw net income and margins improve sequentially from Q4, but both were lower than Q1 2024, while capex increased year-on-year, and FCF declined. Dividends remained strong, demonstrating Aramco’s commitment to shareholder returns.","Robust financial performance highlights reliability, efficiency and low-cost operations

Saudi Aramco I First quarter interim report 2025
Financial performance
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flows are primarily driven 
by market prices and volumes sold of hydrocarbons as well as 
refined and chemicals products.
Shareholders’ returns
• During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the 
79.3 billion ($21.14 billion). 
In addition, the Company distributed performance-linked 
0.8 billion ($0.22 billion). These dividend 
80.1 billion ($21.36 billion), reflect 
Aramco’s commitment to deliver value and share the upside of 
its financial performance with shareholders.
Investment in affiliates
• In January, Aramco completed the acquisition of a 50% equity 
interest in BHIG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of APQ. Following 
the initial investment in January, a subsequent investment was 
0.9 billion 
($0.24 billion). The transaction resulted in a reduction in cash 
and cash equivalents, and a corresponding increase in 
investments in joint ventures and associates.
• In relation to the definitive agreement signed in August 2024 to 
acquire additional shares of Petro Rabigh, Aramco and 
Sumitomo Chemical completed the waiver of the remaining 
amounts in January of their respective shareholder loans to 
0.9 billion ($0.24 billion) each. As a result, 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion), and recorded an addition to its equity 
investment in Petro Rabigh. This resulted in a decrease in 
non-current other assets and receivables, and a corresponding 
increase in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Portfolio optimization
• In February, SABIC completed the sale of its 20.62% 
3.6 billion 
($0.96 billion). As part of the transfer, the carrying amount of 
3.3 billion ($0.88 billion) was 
derecognized. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding decrease in assets classified as 
held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financing arrangements
• In March, SATORP, a joint operation of Aramco, entered into an 
asset transfer transaction with BHIG for upfront cash proceeds of 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion). As part of the transaction, SATORP 
transferred the ownership of a hydrogen manufacturing plant 
to BHIG and concurrently entered into a long-term hydrogen 
offtake agreement. This transaction, accounted for as a 
financing arrangement, resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.
• 2.0 billion 
($0.53 billion) related to the financing arrangement with JIGPC, 
which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents, and 
a corresponding increase in borrowings during the period.
• In March, Aramco extended the maturity date of its Sukuk 
11.3 billion ($3.0 billion). 
The Sukuk, with a maturity date of April 10, 2025, was extended 
to April 10, 2032 with an option to redeem early on October 10, 
2031. This resulted in a reclassification of the Sukuk balance 
from current to non-current borrowings.
• In March, SABIC refinanced a portion of its Murabaha loans, 
8.1 billion ($2.16 
billion), which will be repayable in instalments over a period of 
10 years. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.

Earnings before interest, income taxes and zakat for the first 
4,615 ($1,231)

attributed to weakening refining and chemical margins, inventory 
valuation movement, and certain other non-cash adjustments.
Capital expenditures8,607

movement, partially offset by weakening refining and chemical 
margins, and certain other non-cash adjustments.
Capital expenditures8,607

Compare Aramco’s affiliate investments and capital projects in boosting long-term strategic and financial growth.,,"Aramco’s affiliate investments and capital projects both play crucial roles in boosting its long-term strategic and financial growth. 

Affiliate investments, such as the acquisition of a 50% equity interest in Blue Hydrogen Industrial Gases Company and a 25% stake in Unioil Petroleum Philippines, strengthen Aramco’s presence in lower-carbon energy and downstream markets, supporting diversification and positioning for emerging energy transitions. These investments also increase equity interests and joint ventures, creating new revenue streams and operational synergies.

Capital projects, including the development of major refinery-integrated petrochemical steam crackers, the Amiral expansion at SATORP, and ongoing investments totaling $12.5 billion in Q1 2025, reinforce Aramco’s core operations, improve efficiency, and expand production capacity. These projects are essential for maintaining industry leadership, cost competitiveness, and supporting future earnings growth.

In summary, affiliate investments drive strategic diversification and market expansion, while capital projects underpin operational strength and long-term financial resilience—together ensuring sustained value creation and growth for Aramco.","Robust financial performance highlights reliability, efficiency and low-cost operations

Analyze rare operational anomalies and geopolitical disruptions impacting Aramco’s Q1 2025 variable dividend structure.,,"Aramco’s Q1 2025 variable dividend structure could be impacted by rare operational anomalies and geopolitical disruptions in several ways. According to the context, Aramco’s operational results and cash flows are highly sensitive to fluctuations in global oil supply, demand, and prices, as well as operational risks and hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, geopolitical risks—such as political and social instability, armed conflict in the MENA region, and global economic conditions—can significantly affect business performance.

Any rare operational anomaly (e.g., major unplanned outages, industrial accidents, or supply chain disruptions) could lead to reduced production volumes, affecting hydrocarbon sales and thus impacting cash available for dividends. Similarly, geopolitical disruptions can cause volatility in market prices and disrupt transportation or export of products. Both types of events could reduce Aramco’s earnings, potentially resulting in lower or delayed variable dividend payouts to shareholders for Q1 2025. The variable performance-linked dividend is directly tied to financial results: thus, any adverse operational or geopolitical events would be reflected in modifications to the dividend structure for that period.","16

Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial report 
1. General information 
The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (the “Company”), with headquarters located in Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the “Kingdom”), 
is engaged in prospecting, exploring, drilling and extracting hydrocarbon substances (“Upstream”) and processing, manufacturing, 
refining and marketing these hydrocarbon substances (“Downstream”). The Company was formed on November 13, 1988 by Royal 
Decree No. M/8; however, its history dates back to May 29, 1933 when the Saudi Arabian Government (the “Government”) granted a 
concession to the Company’s predecessor for the right to, among other things, explore the Kingdom for hydrocarbons. Effective 
January 1, 2018, the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 180, dated 1/4/1439H (December 19, 2017), converted the Company to a 
Saudi Joint Stock Company with new Bylaws. 
 
On December 11, 2019, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and its ordinary shares were listed on the Saudi 
Exchange. In connection with the IPO, the Government, being the sole owner of the Company’s shares at such time, sold an 
aggregate of 3.45 billion ordinary shares, or 1.73% of the Company’s share capital. 
 
On February 13, 2022, the Government transferred 4% of the Company's issued shares to the Public Investment Fund (""PIF""), the 
sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom, followed by another transfer of 4% on April 16, 2023 to Saudi Arabian Investment Company 
(""Sanabil Investments""), a wholly-owned company of PIF. Further, on March 7, 2024, the Government transferred an additional 8% 
of the Company's issued shares to PIF’s wholly-owned companies. Furthermore, on June 11, 2024, the Government completed a 
secondary public offering of the Company’s ordinary shares. In connection with the secondary offering, the Government sold an 
aggregate of approximately 1.7 billion shares, representing 0.7% of the Company’s issued shares. This includes 137.6 million ordinary 
shares acquired by the Company from the Government, which have been classified as treasury shares. Following the completion of 
the secondary offering, the Government remains the Company’s largest shareholder, retaining an 81.48% direct shareholding. 
 
The condensed consolidated interim financial report of the Company and its subsidiaries (together “Saudi Aramco”) was approved by 
the Board of Directors on May 9, 2025.

Saudi Aramco I First quarter interim report 2025
Financial performance
Aramco’s results of operations and cash flows are primarily driven 
by market prices and volumes sold of hydrocarbons as well as 
refined and chemicals products.
Shareholders’ returns
• During the three-month period ended March 31, 2025, the 
79.3 billion ($21.14 billion). 
In addition, the Company distributed performance-linked 
0.8 billion ($0.22 billion). These dividend 
80.1 billion ($21.36 billion), reflect 
Aramco’s commitment to deliver value and share the upside of 
its financial performance with shareholders.
Investment in affiliates
• In January, Aramco completed the acquisition of a 50% equity 
interest in BHIG, a wholly-owned subsidiary of APQ. Following 
the initial investment in January, a subsequent investment was 
0.9 billion 
($0.24 billion). The transaction resulted in a reduction in cash 
and cash equivalents, and a corresponding increase in 
investments in joint ventures and associates.
• In relation to the definitive agreement signed in August 2024 to 
acquire additional shares of Petro Rabigh, Aramco and 
Sumitomo Chemical completed the waiver of the remaining 
amounts in January of their respective shareholder loans to 
0.9 billion ($0.24 billion) each. As a result, 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion), and recorded an addition to its equity 
investment in Petro Rabigh. This resulted in a decrease in 
non-current other assets and receivables, and a corresponding 
increase in investments in joint ventures and associates.
Portfolio optimization
• In February, SABIC completed the sale of its 20.62% 
3.6 billion 
($0.96 billion). As part of the transfer, the carrying amount of 
3.3 billion ($0.88 billion) was 
derecognized. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding decrease in assets classified as 
held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financing arrangements
• In March, SATORP, a joint operation of Aramco, entered into an 
asset transfer transaction with BHIG for upfront cash proceeds of 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion). As part of the transaction, SATORP 
transferred the ownership of a hydrogen manufacturing plant 
to BHIG and concurrently entered into a long-term hydrogen 
offtake agreement. This transaction, accounted for as a 
financing arrangement, resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.
• 2.0 billion 
($0.53 billion) related to the financing arrangement with JIGPC, 
which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents, and 
a corresponding increase in borrowings during the period.
• In March, Aramco extended the maturity date of its Sukuk 
11.3 billion ($3.0 billion). 
The Sukuk, with a maturity date of April 10, 2025, was extended 
to April 10, 2032 with an option to redeem early on October 10, 
2031. This resulted in a reclassification of the Sukuk balance 
from current to non-current borrowings.
• In March, SABIC refinanced a portion of its Murabaha loans, 
8.1 billion ($2.16 
billion), which will be repayable in instalments over a period of 
10 years. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.

The Saudi Arabian Oil Company (the “Company”), with headquarters located in Dhahran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the “Kingdom”), 
is engaged in prospecting, exploring, drilling and extracting hydrocarbon substances (“Upstream”) and processing, manufacturing, 
refining and marketing these hydrocarbon substances (“Downstream”). The Company was formed on November 13, 1988 by Royal 
Decree No. M/8; however, its history dates back to May 29, 1933 when the Saudi Arabian Government (the “Government”) granted a 
concession to the Company’s predecessor for the right to, among other things, explore the Kingdom for hydrocarbons. Effective 
January 1, 2018, the Council of Ministers Resolution No. 180, dated 1/4/1439H (December 19, 2017), converted the Company to a 
Saudi Joint Stock Company with new Bylaws. 
 
On December 11, 2019, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) and its ordinary shares were listed on the Saudi 
Exchange. In connection with the IPO, the Government, being the sole owner of the Company’s shares at such time, sold an 
aggregate of 3.45 billion ordinary shares, or 1.73% of the Company’s share capital. 
 
On February 13, 2022, the Government transferred 4% of the Company's issued shares to the Public Investment Fund (""PIF""), the 
sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom, followed by another transfer of 4% on April 16, 2023 to Saudi Arabian Investment Company 
(""Sanabil Investments""), a wholly-owned company of PIF. Further, on March 7, 2024, the Government transferred an additional 8% 
of the Company's issued shares to PIF’s wholly-owned companies. Furthermore, on June 11, 2024, the Government completed a 
secondary public offering of the Company’s ordinary shares. In connection with the secondary offering, the Government sold an 
aggregate of approximately 1.7 billion shares, representing 0.7% of the Company’s issued shares. This includes 137.6 million ordinary 
shares acquired by the Company from the Government, which have been classified as treasury shares. Following the completion of 
the secondary offering, the Government remains the Company’s largest shareholder, retaining an 81.48% direct shareholding.

derecognized. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding decrease in assets classified as 
held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financing arrangements
• In March, SATORP, a joint operation of Aramco, entered into an 
asset transfer transaction with BHIG for upfront cash proceeds of 
0.9 
billion ($0.24 billion). As part of the transaction, SATORP 
transferred the ownership of a hydrogen manufacturing plant 
to BHIG and concurrently entered into a long-term hydrogen 
offtake agreement. This transaction, accounted for as a 
financing arrangement, resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.
• 2.0 billion 
($0.53 billion) related to the financing arrangement with JIGPC, 
which resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents, and 
a corresponding increase in borrowings during the period.
• In March, Aramco extended the maturity date of its Sukuk 
11.3 billion ($3.0 billion). 
The Sukuk, with a maturity date of April 10, 2025, was extended 
to April 10, 2032 with an option to redeem early on October 10, 
2031. This resulted in a reclassification of the Sukuk balance 
from current to non-current borrowings.
• In March, SABIC refinanced a portion of its Murabaha loans, 
8.1 billion ($2.16 
billion), which will be repayable in instalments over a period of 
10 years. This resulted in an increase in cash and cash 
equivalents, and a corresponding increase in borrowings during 
the period.

"Compare change in SAR total assets between 31-Mar-2025 and 31-Dec-2024, including % growth.",,"Between 31-Dec-2024 and 31-Mar-2025, Saudi Aramco’s total assets in SAR increased from 2,423,630 million to 2,444,802 million. This is an increase of 21,172 million SAR.

The percentage growth in total assets is:
(21,172 / 2,423,630) x 100 ≈ 0.87%

So, total assets grew by approximately 0.87% over the period.","All amounts in millions of Saudi Riyals unless otherwise stated

Did ExxonMobil’s Permian asset synergy drive unprecedented liquids output growth vs. prior decades?,,"Yes, ExxonMobil’s Permian asset synergy contributed significantly to unprecedented liquids output growth. In 2024, they achieved the highest liquids production from their overall portfolio in more than 40 years, driven by record production from both their heritage ExxonMobil assets and their newly combined Pioneer assets in the Permian. The company expects more than $3 billion per year in synergy benefits, with production projected to grow from 1.5 million oil-equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million by 2030—a more than 50% increase.","Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   3 
We generated cash flow from operations of $55 billion dollars – also our third highest in a decade – 
to fund profitable growth, maintain our financial strength, and reward shareholders. Excluding 
working capital, our free cash flow more than covered shareholder distributions.  
And, we delivered a return on capital employed of 13%.  
Over five years, our average return on capital employed is an industry-leading 11%.  
When you set aside cash balances and capital in projects that are under construction – and yet to 
start up – our 2024 ROCE rises to roughly 17%, with a five-year average of about 15%.  
Our disciplined approach to investing continues to generate returns well above our cost of capital.  
Every part of our business contributed to our success.   
We’ve built the best Upstream portfolio in the industry. In 2024, we achieved the highest -ever 
production from our advantaged assets, and the highest liquids production from our overall portfolio 
in more than 40 years. 
In the Permian, we delivered record production from both our heritage ExxonMobil assets and our 
Pioneer assets.  
Together, the two are even stronger. As we said last month, we now see an average of more than $3 
billion per year of synergies from our combined assets, with production growing from 1.5 million oil -
equivalent barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 2.3 million barrels per day by 2030 – a more than 
50% increase. This growth will further strengthen U.S. energy security, and we’ll do it with even 
better overall environmental performance.|Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   2 
What our 2024 performance makes clear is that the transformed company we’ve built is delivering.   
We strengthened and further capitalized on our unique competitive advantages of technology, scale, 
integration, execution excellence, and of course, people.  
We demonstrated the strength of our consistent strategy, now in its eighth year of driving greater 
value for society and shareholders alike. 
 We set and achieved ambitious objectives. When we say we’ll do something, we deliver.  
And, we expanded our unrivalled set of opportunities for profitable growth, both now and long into 
the future. The ultimate source of cash, distributions, and shareholder value is unchanging: 
investments in advantaged, high-return assets and projects.  
The proof of our transformation shows up in our performance.   
Operationally, we delivered strong results across the board … including safety, a bedrock 
commitment underpinning everything we do … reliability, where we achieved record performance in 
our Product Solutions business … and emissions, where we’ve achieved a more than 60% reduction 
in methane intensity since 2016.  
Financially, we demonstrated our steadily improving earnings power across a range of metrics.  
We delivered earnings of $34 billion dollars in 2024, our third-highest result in a decade despite 
softer market conditions. Over five years, we’ve grown earnings, excluding identified items, at a 
compounded annual growth rate of nearly 30%.|Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   8 
To drive further innovation and reduce the most emissions at the lowest cost, policies must remain 
technology agnostic. Governments should not pick winners and losers. Intensity standards establish 
a level playing field, and have a strong precedent. They were most recently used to successfully and 
affordably reduce sulfur in marine fuel.  
In closing, I want to say again how proud I am of the people of ExxonMobil, and how pleased I am 
that we are creating unmatched value for our shareholders.  
Compared to the IOCs, over the last five years we’ve grown cash flow from operations at a roughly 
15% compounded annual growth rate, more than double the closest competitor.  
We’ve distributed more than $125 billion dollars in dividends and buybacks, $30 billion dollars more 
than the closest competitor. 
And we’ve delivered a total shareholder return compounded annual growth of 14%, 600 basis points 
higher than the closest competitor. 
Looking ahead, the value-creation arc of the company is equally distinguished.  
We’re going to build an even more advantaged asset portfolio, with 60% of our Upstream 
production from advantaged assets by 2030. That’s nearly the same amount as the next largest IOC’s 
total production. 
We’re going to develop an even more profitable product mix, with 80% growth of high -value 
product sales in Product Solutions by 2030. 
We’re going to be an even more efficient operator, taking an additional $6 billion dollars in cost out 
of the business.",./dataset_2/pt3\4Q24 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf

Evaluate ExxonMobil’s 2024 ROCE excluding projects under construction versus industry-leading IOC peers.,,"ExxonMobil’s 2024 return on capital employed (ROCE), excluding cash and capital in projects under construction, is approximately 17%. This is notably higher than its five-year industry-leading average of 11% (or 15% when similarly adjusted). Compared to other international oil companies (IOCs), these figures reinforce ExxonMobil’s position as the leader in capital efficiency among peers, with its consistently higher ROCE demonstrating a sustained competitive advantage.","Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   3

"How does ExxonMobil’s $20B buyback and Pioneer cash flow impact sustainable, competitive, and growing dividend policy?",,"ExxonMobil increased its buyback pace to $20 billion annually, largely due to incremental cash flow from the Pioneer acquisition. While this buyback aligns with the number of Pioneer shares issued, management states this is coincidental and not a direct link. Regarding dividends, ExxonMobil maintains that their policy is to ensure dividends remain sustainable, competitive, and growing, and reviews them with this in mind. The increased cash flow enhances capacity for dividends, but they continue to prioritize a prudent, sustainable approach over rapid increases.","Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   16

philosophy - buybacks versus dividends. And I want to kind of position it like this: 
If I look at the buybacks last year and the $20 billion commitment for the next two years, you could 
make a case that you're basically buying back the shares you issued for Pioneer.  And, I know it's not 
as cut and dried as that, but I'm curious with the inflection in free cash flow that you clearly have, 
your capacity for dividend growth is substantially greater than the 4% bump that you gave to 
shareholders now for several years running. Are you waiting to buy in the Pioneer stock before you 
step up that dividend is my question? 
Kathy Mikells:  And so, that's really, Doug, coincidence, right, that we moved up our buyback pace in 
conjunction with Pioneer, obviously, because Pioneer was giving us incremental cash flow to be able 
to do that. So that moved up our pace from $17.5 billion to $20 billion annua lly. And we've guided 
that we expect to be at that pace for this year and next year, assuming continued reasonable market 
conditions.  
But it is, I would say, just a coincidence that that $20 billion pace means that we'll essentially buy 
back the shares from Pioneer over a three-year period. 
If we go to look at our philosophy overall in terms of the dividend, we have been clear that we look at 
that dividend and we want it to be sustainable, we want it to be competitive, and we want it to be 
growing. And we're always looking at it through that lens.",./dataset_2/pt3\4Q24 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf
Examine implications of non-core asset divestitures on ExxonMobil’s long-term dividend growth trajectory.,,"Non-core asset divestitures can support ExxonMobil’s long-term dividend growth by providing additional cash flow and streamlining the portfolio, allowing the company to focus on higher-return core assets. As explained in the earnings call, ExxonMobil’s dividend growth strategy prioritizes sustainability, competitiveness, and steady growth. By divesting non-core assets and redeploying capital to more profitable operations, ExxonMobil improves its capacity to sustain and potentially increase dividends over time, assuming continued reasonable market conditions.","Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   16

How do ExxonMobil’s buyback and dividend policies compare in priority and drivers post-Pioneer acquisition?,,"ExxonMobil’s buyback and dividend policies are both important but serve different purposes. Post-Pioneer acquisition, the company increased its share buyback pace from $17.5 billion to $20 billion annually, driven partly by the incremental cash flow from Pioneer. However, management states this timing is coincidental and not directly tied to repurchasing the Pioneer shares. The dividend policy remains focused on sustainability, competitiveness, and consistent growth, as evidenced by multiple years of a 4% increase. In summary, ExxonMobil maintains steady, sustainable dividend growth while using buybacks opportunistically, supported by increased free cash flow from the acquisition.","Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   16

How does ExxonMobil plan to double US output and boost LNG FID cadence for 20/30 targets?,,"ExxonMobil plans to double US output and boost LNG FID (Final Investment Decision) cadence to achieve its 20/30 targets by focusing on low cost-of-supply projects, leveraging its project and technology organizations to gain a competitive advantage, and optimizing trading opportunities as markets become more liquid. Specifically, they aim to deliver $20 billion more in earnings and $30 billion more in cash flow by 2030, supported by increasing US production and advancing key LNG projects such as Papua LNG, PNG, and Rovuma, with targeted FIDs expected (PNG near end-2024 and Rovuma in 2026). These initiatives are underpinned by strict return and risk criteria to ensure advantaged, resilient assets and sustained shareholder returns.","Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   22 
And, as Kathy mentioned earlier in the call, the project organization that we’ve had brings a huge 
advantage in this space to help us drive these projects to the left-hand side of the cost of supply 
curve. I'd also add that our Technology organization that we've established and the focus that they're 
putting on and working with the projects organization is another advantage  that helps kind of drive 
that to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve. So that's, I would say, the primary variables at 
play here. Obviously, we look at the stability of the area that that we're in.  We've got a really long 
history of managing that exposure and risk. We feel pretty good around what we're seeing in the 
local communities that we're looking at and the steps that we can take to make sure that we can 
develop a long-term successful business there and a stable environment. So I think that piece of it, 
while certainly something that we need to manage and be aware of isn't impacting, isn't the largest 
variable with respect to how we think about moving forward on these projects. 
Bob Brackett:  Very clear. So, we should think 2025 for PNG and 2026 for Rovuma still? 
Darren Woods:   We're working towards the 2026 timeframe in the Rovuma and PNG, we're 
continuing to work through a target. Hopefully, you have something near the back end of this year

an additional $30 billion by 2030. And think that goes along with the US production, I think, doubling 
or increasing. I'm just wondering, in order to achieve this, I'm just wondering, what type of levels are|Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   21

value through trading. And so, we're making sure that we've got volume available for that.

Operator:  The next question is from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research.

cadence this year and next. You've got Papua LNG and PNG. You've got Rovuma and maybe even 
Coral North in Mozambique. Those are very different investments than adding another well in the 
Permian. What do you need to see in terms of maybe returns and certainty and maybe even local 
situation to give you the confidence to move forward on those multi-decadal assets? 
Darren Woods:   Good morning, Bob, thanks for the question.  
You're right that each of these projects are somewhat unique. However, what I would tell you is the 
constant here in terms of how we're evaluating and deciding to go forward is making sure that 
they're low cost-of-supply. So they're competitive supply sources in a market so that as we move 
forward, irrespective of how the market develops in the highs and the lows that we have an 
advantaged cost of supply vis-à-vis the rest of supply curve and some of our competitors. So that's a 
critical component. And with that comes in an advantaged project and advantaged returns.  And so 
that is fundamental to what we're looking at with each of these.|Excerpt from ExxonMobil 4Q24 Earnings Call   9

you're watching for in 2025 at this asset, how it continues to track relative to expectations? And 
there's been a lot of investor debate following the Upstream day about what the long-term capacity 
of this asset could look like. So, any thoughts on terminal plateau would be great.

"How do ExxonMobil's FID considerations for cost-of-supply, org. advantage, and regional stability compare?",,"ExxonMobil’s FID (Final Investment Decision) considerations prioritize projects with a low cost-of-supply to ensure competitiveness across market cycles. The company leverages its project and technology organizations as key advantages to consistently drive projects to the favorable (left-hand) side of the cost-of-supply curve, affording them strong returns versus peers.

"Analyze cascading effects of cross-border regulatory shifts on streaming revenue, content delivery, and platform adaption.",,"Cross-border regulatory shifts can have several cascading effects on streaming revenue, content delivery, and platform adoption. Stricter or changing regulations may impact the company’s ability to compete effectively, potentially affecting consumer engagement and adoption of new plans such as ads or paid sharing. Regulatory challenges can disrupt the expansion and maintenance of device platforms used for streaming, influencing how and where content is delivered. Additionally, these changes may create uncertainty around timing and variety of content releases, and could expose the company to production risks or impact service continuity—all of which might result in fluctuations in consumer usage and revenue. As highlighted in the context, these risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from forecasts, impacting both short-term revenue and long-term growth strategies.","

"How do intertwined competition, consumer trends, macro shifts, and content timing impact actual results vs. forecasts?",,"Intertwined factors such as competition, consumer trends, macroeconomic conditions, and content timing can cause actual results to differ significantly from forecasts. Increased competition and shifting consumer engagement with different entertainment modes may affect membership growth and retention. Macroeconomic conditions can influence consumer usage and spending. The timing and variety of content releases impact engagement levels. These elements, along with service disruptions and production risks, contribute to the variability between internal forecasts and actual performance, as discussed in the company's filings with the SEC.","

"How do management's reasons for using F/X neutral rev., adj. op. profit, FCF, and net debt differ?",,"Management uses F/X neutral revenue and adjusted operating profit/margin to help investors compare projected to actual results without the impact of currency fluctuations or restructuring costs. Free cash flow (FCF) is used as a key liquidity metric that shows the cash available for debt repayment, acquisitions, investments, or stock buybacks. Net debt is considered a useful measure for assessing the company’s liquidity, capital structure, and leverage. Each metric provides a different perspective—F/X neutral and adjusted profit focus on operational comparison, while FCF and net debt assess financial health and flexibility.","

"Compare how private vs. public markets restrict investor access to data centers, including min. investment requirements.",,"Public markets, such as stock exchanges, allow broad investor access with relatively low minimum investments; anyone can buy shares of publicly traded companies. In contrast, access to data center investments—infrastructure that is rapidly growing and costly (a single AI data center can cost $40-50 billion)—is almost exclusively through private markets. These private markets limit participation to wealthy individuals or large institutions, require higher minimum investments, and often restrict access based on income or net worth. Thus, while public markets are open and accessible, private markets, where data center assets reside, are much more exclusive and out of reach for most individual investors.","6 
Figure 2.1:13 
 
Over the past year, I've argued that governments—already weighed down by historic 
deficits—cannot rely solely on taxpayers to shoulder the staggering costs of new 
infrastructure without risking a debt spiral. But governments aren't alone in facing 
constraints. Even the world’s largest tech companies, despite their billions in free cash flow, 
aren't equipped for this scale of investment. A single AI data center can cost between $40 
billion and $50 billion.14 
When I talk to tech leaders, they often tell me their companies want to stay focused on what 
they do best—inventing groundbreaking technology, not on financing the massive 
infrastructure needed to deploy it. 
The markets are eager to step in where governments and corporations are stepping out. 
Investors are already voting with their dollars—making infrastructure one of the world's 
fastest-growing market segments. This investment, however, is being throttled because 
of the way our capital markets are structured.  
Private markets are private 
Most of us associate ""markets"" with public markets—stocks, bonds, commodities. But you 
generally cannot buy shares in a new high-speed rail line or a next-generation power grid 
on the London or New York Stock Exchange. Instead, infrastructure projects are typically 
investable only through private markets. 
Private markets are, as their name suggests, private. For individual investors, they often 
require higher minimum investments. And even when the minimums are lower, investing 
is often limited to people with a certain income or net worth.  
The same hurdles apply to most of the world’s companies. Only a tiny fraction are publicly 
traded, and that fraction is shrinking: The path BlackRock took 25 years ago—raising 
money through an IPO—is becoming rarer. Instead, 81% of U.S. companies with over $100 
million in revenue are privately held. The percentage is higher in the EU, and even higher in 
the U.K.

Assets that will define the future—data centers, ports, power grids, the world’s fastest-
growing private companies—aren’t available to most investors. They're in private markets, 
locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market 
participants. 
The reason for the exclusivity has always been risk. Illiquidity. Complexity. That’s why only 
certain investors are allowed in. But nothing in finance is immutable. Private markets don’t 
have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to 
innovate—and that’s exactly what we’ve spent the past year doing at BlackRock. 
BlackRock has always had a foot in private markets. But we’ve been—first and foremost—a 
traditional asset manager. That’s who we were at the start of 2024. But it’s not who we are 
anymore. 
In the past 14 months, we've announced the acquisition of two of the top firms in the 
fastest-growing areas of private markets: infrastructure and private credit. We bought 
another firm to get better data and analytics, so we can better measure risk, spot 
opportunities, and unlock access to private markets. 
We’ve transformed our company. The next section details why we did it, how we did it, 
and why it matters. 
The $68 trillion investment boom: Who will own it?  
Throughout history, infrastructure has driven a surprising amount of economic growth. 
Between 1860 and 1890, just building railroads boosted U.S. GDP by roughly 25%.9  
A century later, highways did something similar: By one measure, investments in the 
interstate system accounted for about a quarter of productivity gains between 1950 and 
1989.10 
Today, we're standing at the edge of an opportunity so vast it's almost hard to grasp. 
By 2040, the global demand for new infrastructure investment is $68 trillion.11 To put that 
price tag in perspective, it’s roughly the equivalent of building the entire Interstate 
Highway System and the Transcontinental Railroad, start to finish, every six weeks— 
for the next 15 years.12

productivity would have been 25% lower in 1890 in the absence of railroads, with an associated annual loss of $3 billion or 25% of GDP

12 This calculation is based on approximate historical cost estimates adjusted for real terms. The total cost of the U.S. Interstate Highway System is estimated at 
approximately $500 billion, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The cost of the Transcontinental Railroad, adjusted for today’s dollars, is estimated at 
approximately $1.2 billion, according to History.com. The combined cost of these two projects, approximately $501.2 billion, would need to be replicated 135.67 times 
over the next 15 years to match the estimated global infrastructure investment needs. Given that there are 780 weeks in 15 years, this equates to completing one such 
project approximately every six weeks. These figures are approximations based on historical data and serve to illustrate the scale of global infrastructure demands rather 
than precise investment requirements

Assess the impact of tokenized infrastructure funds on democratizing private market investments.,,"Tokenized infrastructure funds have the potential to significantly democratize private market investments. Currently, most infrastructure assets—such as data centers, ports, and power grids—are locked in private markets, accessible only to wealthy individuals and large institutions due to high minimum investments and restrictive criteria. Tokenization can lower these barriers by allowing fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and simplifying access. This innovation would let a broader range of investors participate in the $68 trillion infrastructure investment opportunity expected by 2040, a market historically confined to a privileged few. By leveraging technology and new investment structures, tokenized funds could open private markets, making them less risky, less opaque, and more accessible—aligning with BlackRock’s push to unlock access and drive broader participation.","6

Why do high minimums and limited access in private infra mkts exclude most retail investors?,,"High minimums and limited access in private infrastructure markets exclude most retail investors because these markets are typically only open to participants with high income or net worth, requiring significant minimum investments.

price tag in perspective, it’s roughly the equivalent of building the entire Interstate 
Highway System and the Transcontinental Railroad, start to finish, every six weeks— 
for the next 15 years.12

productivity would have been 25% lower in 1890 in the absence of railroads, with an associated annual loss of $3 billion or 25% of GDP

investment will substantially extend the lifetime of an asset but excluding land purchases. Needs determined on the basis that countries match the performance of their 
best performing peers in terms of the resources they dedicate to infrastructure investment. Investment need calculated from 2024-2040 
12 This calculation is based on approximate historical cost estimates adjusted for real terms. The total cost of the U.S. Interstate Highway System is estimated at 
approximately $500 billion, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The cost of the Transcontinental Railroad, adjusted for today’s dollars, is estimated at 
approximately $1.2 billion, according to History.com. The combined cost of these two projects, approximately $501.2 billion, would need to be replicated 135.67 times 
over the next 15 years to match the estimated global infrastructure investment needs. Given that there are 780 weeks in 15 years, this equates to completing one such 
project approximately every six weeks. These figures are approximations based on historical data and serve to illustrate the scale of global infrastructure demands rather 
than precise investment requirements

"How do real estate/infrastructure in 401(k)s affect returns, retirement length, and savings security vs pensions?",,"Including private assets like real estate and infrastructure in 401(k)s can significantly improve outcomes for savers. Historically, pensions have invested in these assets for decades, helping them outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% per year. Over 40 years, that extra 0.5% annual return results in around 14.5% more wealth at retirement, which can translate into nine more years of retirement spending at your final salary level. This boost greatly enhances both savings security and retirement length—making 401(k)s more comparable to pensions, which already provide steady income and higher returns due in part to their private asset allocations. Overall, bringing private assets into 401(k)s can help close the performance gap and make retirement savings more secure and lasting.","15 
We're going to need better ways to boost portfolios. As I wrote earlier, private assets like real 
estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns. 
Pension funds have invested in these assets for decades, but 401(k)s haven't. It’s one 
reason why pensions typically outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% each year.40 
Half a percent doesn't sound huge, but it adds up over time. BlackRock estimates that over 
40 years, an extra 0.5% in annual returns results in 14.5% more money in your 401(k). 
It’s enough to fund nine more years of retirement, helping you stop working on your own 
terms. Or, put another way, private assets just bought you nine extra years hanging out 
with your grandkids.41 
If private assets perform so well, why aren't they in your 401(k)? One major reason is that 
it's unfamiliar territory for the 401(k) providers who select the investments offered in your 
plan.  
When you invest in private assets—like a bridge, for example—the values of those assets 
aren’t updated daily, and you can't withdraw your money whenever you want. It's a bridge, 
after all—not a stock. While BlackRock, as I've previously written, is working to make the 
markets for these assets more price-transparent and liquid, many 401(k) providers haven't 
yet adapted to this evolving financial landscape. Indeed, including assets like real estate or 
infrastructure in a 401(k) has become practical only within the past five to ten years.  
This is complex stuff. It requires clarification. Asset managers, private-market specialists, 
consultants, and advisors all play a role in guiding 401(k) providers. That's part of the 
reason I'm writing this letter—to cut through the fog. We need to make it clear: Private 
assets are legal in retirement accounts. They're beneficial. And they're becoming 
increasingly transparent. 
Target date funds are a great place to start. People love their simplicity: You just pick 
the year you plan to retire—2040, 2055, 2060—and let the fund do the rest. That simplicity 
makes target date funds ideal for introducing private assets. The usual barriers for 401(k) 
providers—like daily valuations or immediate liquidity—matter far less when you're 
investing over several decades. 
How can we help people spend what they’ve saved?  
Building a nest egg is only half the challenge. The other half—especially for 401(k) savers—
is knowing how to spend it. 
Most pension holders don’t worry about this. Their income arrives each month, like a 
steady paycheck. But a 401(k) doesn’t come with instructions. When you retire, you're 
handed a lump sum and asked to make it last for the rest of your life—without knowing how 
long that will be.  
The result? Even retirees who’ve saved well often spend too little, gripped by fear that they’ll 
run out. They downsize dreams and delay joy. The economist Bill Sharpe called this 
problem the ""nastiest, hardest problem in finance."" Hard, but solvable. 
Last year, BlackRock introduced LifePath Paycheck® to tackle this fear. It gives people the 
option to convert 401(k) retirement savings into a steady, reliable monthly income. In just 
12 months, LifePath Paycheck® has already attracted six plan sponsor clients representing 
200,000 individual retirement savers.  
 
40 BlackRock, Alternative investments in target date funds, (2022) 
41 The ""nine additional years"" claim is derived using BlackRock's LifePath spending algorithm, based on the following assumptions: an individual begins saving at age 25, 
contributes consistently at a rate of 9% of a dynamically increasing salary over a 40-year accumulation period, and invests in a simplified two-asset portfolio (equities and 
fixed income). By applying an incremental net-of-fee outperformance (alpha) of 50 basis points (0.50%) per annum over this entire period, the portfolio accumulates 
approximately 14.5% more wealth by retirement age (65), compared to a similar portfolio without this incremental alpha. Using LifePath's spending calculation—which 
assumes a conservative retirement portfolio allocation of 40% equities and 60% fixed income—this increased wealth accumulation translates directly into the capacity for 
an estimated nine additional years of retirement spending at the individual’s retirement-year salary level, all else equal

From retirement 
to tokenization 
How all of us can democratize investing 
On September 30, 1933, during the depths of the Great Depression, a small California 
newspaper, The Long Beach Telegram, published a letter from Francis Townsend. He was 
a local doctor who’d written his letter in a burst of anger after witnessing elderly women 
scavenging for food in the street. His proposal—$200 per month for every American over 
60—touched off the movement that led to Social Security in the U.S.26 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Social Security keeps nearly 30 million Americans 
from sliding into poverty each year—an extraordinary achievement.27 And yet, projections 
show Social Security’s retirement and disability funds will run out by 2035. After that, 
people would get only 83% of their promised benefits, and that percentage will drop over 
time.28 
But even if we shore up Social Security, it’s not enough. The system was designed to do 
exactly what Francis Townsend had in mind: keep older people out of poverty. But escaping 
poverty doesn't equal financial security. That’s why today, even with the promise of Social 
Security, more than half of Americans still fear outliving their savings more than death 
itself.29 
A good retirement system provides a safety net to catch people when they fall. But a great 
system also offers a ladder—a way to grow savings, compounding wealth year after year. 
That’s where the U.S. falls short. Right now, the country focuses heavily on preventing 
people from hitting the floor, as we should. But the U.S. needs to put just as much effort 
into helping people climb to the ceiling—through investing. 
More than half the money BlackRock manages is retirement money.30 It’s our core 
business, which makes sense: For most people, retirement accounts are their first—and 
often their only—experience with investing. So, if we really want to democratize investing, 
retirement is where the conversation has to start. 
While BlackRock helps people invest for retirement all over the world, I want to focus on 
the U.S. in this section. Because the situation is dire. Public pensions are facing huge 
shortfalls. Nationwide, the data shows they’re only about 80% funded—and that’s probably 
an overly optimistic number.31 Meanwhile, a third of the country has no retirement 
savings at all. No pensions, no 401(k)—nothing.32  
As money runs shorter, lives are getting longer. Today, if you're married and both of you 
reach 65, there's a 50/50 chance at least one of you lives until 90.33 And with biomedical 
breakthroughs like GLP-1 drugs, many more chronic diseases might soon become curable.

"Analyze how pensions, Social Security, and 401(k)s differ in preventing and alleviating longevity risk.",,"Pensions, Social Security, and 401(k)s differ significantly in how they address longevity risk—the danger of outliving one’s savings:

- **Pensions**: Provide guaranteed monthly income for life, mimicking a “steady paycheck” and directly protecting retirees from longevity risk. Pension income continues regardless of how long you live, removing the need for individuals to manage their withdrawals.

- **Social Security**: Also gives retirees a monthly, government-backed benefit for life. It keeps nearly 30 million Americans out of poverty and forms a basic safety net against longevity risk. However, Social Security is projected to only be able to pay 83% of promised benefits after 2035 unless changes are made.

- **401(k)s**: Typically provide a lump sum at retirement with no structured payout, leaving retirees to determine how to spend their savings over an unknown time period. Many retirees end up underspending out of fear of running out of money, leading to reduced quality of life. Without additional solutions, 401(k)s do not inherently protect against longevity risk.

**Summary:**  
Pensions and Social Security minimize longevity risk via lifelong income streams, while 401(k)s place the risk and management burden on individuals, making it harder to ensure retirement savings last. New products like LifePath Paycheck® aim to bridge this gap by converting 401(k) balances into steady income.","15

"Assess the changes in BlackRock's private mkts AUM, workforce, and tech post-Preqin and pending HPS deals.",,"BlackRock's private markets AUM and capabilities are set to expand significantly following the Preqin acquisition and the planned HPS deal. After closing these acquisitions, BlackRock expects its alternatives platform to become a top five provider with $600 billion in client assets and over $3 billion in annual revenue. These deals will bolster BlackRock’s investment and data capabilities in private markets.

Workforce-wise, BlackRock has grown from 650 employees at IPO to nearly 23,000 globally, and recent and pending acquisitions are expected to bring in more top talent.

On the technology front, integrating Preqin with Aladdin and eFront enhances BlackRock’s whole-portfolio tech ecosystem, especially for private markets, supporting more customized client solutions and helping shift BlackRock’s revenue toward higher long-term, less market-sensitive products.","23 
BlackRock’s 
performance 
2024-2025 
Last fall, we celebrated the 25th anniversary of BlackRock’s initial public offering (IPO). 
When we went public, we had just 650 employees and our stock was listed at $14 a share. 
We managed $165 billion of primarily fixed income-based assets for our clients, and we 
had just started selling Aladdin’s technology externally.  
Today, we manage $11.6 trillion for our clients, and Aladdin generates more than $1.6 
billion in annual revenue. Our employee base is now almost 23,000 strong, with offices in 
more than 30 countries. Our stock ended 2024 at over $1,000 per share. But even 25 years 
since our IPO and 37 since our founding, this is in many ways just the beginning of the 
BlackRock story.  
2024 was a milestone year for BlackRock. Clients entrusted us with a record $641 billion 
of net inflows. We added $1.5 trillion to AUM, and delivered record revenue and operating 
income, alongside a 29% total return for our shareholders.  
In a dynamic investing and re-risking environment, clients wanted to step back into the 
markets more actively. They did it with BlackRock. We closed the year with back-to-back 
record net inflow quarters, ending the year with $281 billion of net inflows in the fourth 
quarter for 7% organic base fee growth. Importantly, that organic growth was broad-based 
across institutional, wealth, and regions. Clients want to consolidate more of their 
portfolios with a partner that is with them for the long term as they work toward their own 
commercial ambitions and portfolio goals. They want portfolios that are seamlessly 
integrated across public and private markets, that are dynamic, and that are underpinned 
by data, risk management and technology.  
This historic client activity took place as we executed on the most significant acquisitions 
we’ve done since BGI more than 15 years ago. Our closings of GIP and Preqin, and planned 
acquisition of HPS later this year, are expected to scale and enhance our private markets 
investment and data capabilities. 
Clients have always been at the center of our strategy, and we’ve intentionally invested to 
serve the full breadth of their needs. We have built a differentiated asset management and 
fintech platform that is fully integrated across both public and private markets.  
Following our planned acquisition of HPS, we expect BlackRock’s alternatives platform to 
become a top five provider for clients, with $600 billion in client assets and over $3 billion 
in annual revenue. That will be integrated with BlackRock’s platform that already houses 
the world’s #1 global ETF franchise, $3 trillion in fixed income, a $700 billion insurance 
asset management practice, advisory services, and our proven Aladdin technology.  
Aladdin is powering a whole portfolio ecosystem across public and private markets with 
eFront and our recent acquisition of Preqin. This growing platform changes the complexion 
of BlackRock – one that we feel delivers for client needs and results in over 20% of our 
revenue base in long-dated, less market-sensitive products and services. Our revenue mix 
will continue to shift organically as private markets, technology and customized solutions 
experience higher secular growth. We believe this will translate to higher and more durable 
organic growth, greater resilience through market cycles, and long-term value for 
shareholders. 
MKTGM0425U/M-4376572-23/27|24 
Clients have embraced our strategy. Our track record of successful acquisitions and 
integrations is deepening our clients’ relationships with BlackRock. Our ETF franchise 
delivered record net inflows of $390 billion, which again led the industry. Since our 
acquisition of iShares, BlackRock has led in expanding the market for ETFs by delivering 
new asset classes like bonds or cryptocurrencies, alongside innovative investment 
products like active strategies in a more liquid and transparent vehicle. 
Approximately a quarter of our ETF net inflows were into products launched in the last five 
years. Our active ETFs delivered $22 billion in net inflows in 2024, while BlackRock’s U.S.-
based Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) was the largest exchange-traded product 
launch in history, growing to over $50 billion of AUM in less than a year. And it was the 
third-highest asset gatherer in the entire ETF industry, behind only S&P 500 index funds. 
We’re innovating at the product and portfolio level and accelerating our distribution 
capabilities to deliver differentiated investment solutions. 
Client needs are driving industry consolidation, and investors increasingly prefer to work 
with BlackRock because of our capabilities as a scaled, multi-asset provider. We see this in 
the wealth channel, where managed model portfolios are the main way in which wealth 
managers are looking to grow their practices and better serve their clients. BlackRock has 
a leading models business, backed by our multi-asset, multi-product capabilities. We’re 
also working across our wealth platform to provide increasingly personalized offerings to 
our financial advisor partners and their clients, including through customized separately 
managed accounts (SMAs). We offer index SMAs through Aperio, which had its fourth 
consecutive record year in 2024 with $14 billion of net inflows. And last year, we acquired 
SpiderRock Advisors, which offers tax-advantaged option overlay strategies, to grow our 
suite of customized offerings in the wealth channel. 
These clients include the world’s largest asset owners, pension plans, and corporates, who 
are deepening ties to BlackRock. Many of these corporate partners see positive network 
effects to their core business, and to their own shareholders, by extending their 
relationships with BlackRock. Last year our clients entrusted us with more than $120 
billion of scaled outsourcing mandates.  
The differentiated advice and alpha generation potential of our actively managed 
strategies continue to resonate with clients, driving more than $60 billion of active net 
inflows in 2024. Active flows were led by our LifePath target date franchise, outsourcing 
mandates, and our tech and data-driven systematic active equity strategies. We’re 
delivering long-term investment performance, and we think active strategies can provide 
an advantage in an environment that requires a more dynamic approach to allocations. 
In fixed income, clients are turning to BlackRock to navigate a transitional rate 
environment, driving $164 billion of net inflows last year. We see a significant reallocation 
opportunity for the record $10 trillion of cash held on the sidelines, as many investors will 
need yields beyond the 4% currently earned in a money-market account in order to meet 
long-term goals like retirement. 
Our clients continue to increase their allocations to private markets as a source of 
diversification and uncorrelated alpha generation potential. Private markets net inflows of 
$9 billion included strong demand for infrastructure and private credit strategies. Client 
feedback surrounding the recent and planned acquisitions of GIP and HPS has exceeded 
even our own high expectations, and we expect these to drive significant future net inflows 
and revenue growth in 2025 and beyond. 
We’ve delivered our Aladdin technology to clients for a little over 25 years now, and it only 
started following robust internal debate over whether to even offer it externally. It was a 
good decision for BlackRock and our clients. What we initially pioneered as our own 
internal risk-management tool is now the most comprehensive, fully integrated operating 
system in the industry. 
We signed some of our most significant mandates in Aladdin’s history in 2024, and more 
than half of Aladdin sales included multiple products. Our acquisition of Preqin, which

We’re also laying the groundwork to enable future growth as countries look to build out 
their own capital markets. I’ve spent time in the Middle East and Asia already this year, and 
the development of more robust and prosperous local capital markets has been central to 
many of my discussions with local leaders. In Saudi Arabia, we’re partnering with the 
Public Investment Fund to encourage investment and further develop their local capital 
markets. And in India, our joint venture Jio BlackRock is preparing to launch a digitally 
enabled asset management and wealth platform.  
Total compounded annual total return since BlackRock’s IPO through December 31, 2024 
As we celebrate 25 years as a public company, we’re also proud of the differentiated returns 
we’ve delivered for our shareholders. Since our IPO in 1999, we’ve generated an annualized 
total return of 21%, compared to 8% for the S&P 500 and 6% for the financials industry. 
It’s our bold strategy and coordinated investments that drive our deep connections with 
clients, and strong returns for our shareholders.

Our world-class talent is central to our decades of growth and sustained performance. We 
regularly evaluate our talent strategy to make sure we are developing well-rounded leaders 
with a breadth of experience across our business. Earlier this year, we elevated several of 
our leaders to new roles across the firm. 
After 20 years building a number of businesses at BlackRock, Mark Wiedman has decided 
to pursue the next chapter in his career outside of the firm. Mark has helped shape the 
BlackRock we know today, including his work leading iShares, Corporate Strategy, and 
most recently our Global Client Business. Mark is a great friend of mine, and I’m personally 
thankful to him for his contributions to the firm.  
I’m proud of the deep leadership team we’ve assembled, and our recent and pending 
acquisitions will bring an influx of top talent to our firm. Across our entire platform, we’re

"Analyze how BlackRock’s acquisitions, tech-enabled integration, and ETF/active strategy growth drove 2024’s record results.",,"BlackRock’s record results in 2024 were driven by:  
**1. Strategic Acquisitions:** Major deals like GIP, Preqin (closed), and the planned HPS purchase expanded BlackRock’s private markets and data capabilities. These moves positioned BlackRock’s alternatives platform to become a top five provider, expected to manage $600 billion in assets and generate over $3 billion in annual revenue.

**2. Tech-Enabled Integration:** BlackRock’s Aladdin platform, strengthened by the Preqin acquisition and integration with eFront, created a seamless ecosystem across public and private markets. Aladdin generated more than $1.6 billion in annual revenue and won major mandates, with over half including multiple products.

**3. ETF and Active Strategy Growth:** BlackRock led the industry with $390 billion in ETF net inflows, a record, and strong innovation—such as launching active ETFs and the largest Bitcoin ETP in history (over $50 billion AUM in under a year). Active strategies also performed strongly, pulling in $60 billion of net inflows, led by target date funds and systematic equity strategies.

These factors contributed to $641 billion in total net inflows and a 29% total shareholder return in 2024, with growth diversified across institutional and wealth channels, robust product innovation, and increased organic base fee growth.","23

We’ve delivered our Aladdin technology to clients for a little over 25 years now, and it only 
started following robust internal debate over whether to even offer it externally. It was a 
good decision for BlackRock and our clients. What we initially pioneered as our own 
internal risk-management tool is now the most comprehensive, fully integrated operating 
system in the industry. 
We signed some of our most significant mandates in Aladdin’s history in 2024, and more 
than half of Aladdin sales included multiple products. Our acquisition of Preqin, which

We’re also laying the groundwork to enable future growth as countries look to build out 
their own capital markets. I’ve spent time in the Middle East and Asia already this year, and 
the development of more robust and prosperous local capital markets has been central to 
many of my discussions with local leaders. In Saudi Arabia, we’re partnering with the 
Public Investment Fund to encourage investment and further develop their local capital 
markets. And in India, our joint venture Jio BlackRock is preparing to launch a digitally 
enabled asset management and wealth platform.  
Total compounded annual total return since BlackRock’s IPO through December 31, 2024 
As we celebrate 25 years as a public company, we’re also proud of the differentiated returns 
we’ve delivered for our shareholders. Since our IPO in 1999, we’ve generated an annualized 
total return of 21%, compared to 8% for the S&P 500 and 6% for the financials industry. 
It’s our bold strategy and coordinated investments that drive our deep connections with 
clients, and strong returns for our shareholders.

Our world-class talent is central to our decades of growth and sustained performance. We 
regularly evaluate our talent strategy to make sure we are developing well-rounded leaders 
with a breadth of experience across our business. Earlier this year, we elevated several of 
our leaders to new roles across the firm. 
After 20 years building a number of businesses at BlackRock, Mark Wiedman has decided 
to pursue the next chapter in his career outside of the firm. Mark has helped shape the 
BlackRock we know today, including his work leading iShares, Corporate Strategy, and 
most recently our Global Client Business. Mark is a great friend of mine, and I’m personally 
thankful to him for his contributions to the firm.  
I’m proud of the deep leadership team we’ve assembled, and our recent and pending 
acquisitions will bring an influx of top talent to our firm. Across our entire platform, we’re 
positioning our people to deliver value for our clients and power our business into the 
future.

"Which FY24 initiatives and jackpot events most drove Lotteries’ $250m revenue beat, considering digital/retail turnover impacts?",,"The $250 million FY24 revenue beat in Lotteries was primarily driven by highly favourable jackpot outcomes, specifically the deployment of two Powerball sequences resulting in record $200 million and $150 million draws, and a strong Oz Lotto jackpot run culminating in a $90 million Boxing Day draw. These events were further leveraged by significant marketing activities aimed at customer retention and acquisition.

On channel performance, both digital and retail turnover contributed: retail turnover grew by 6.6%, while digital turnover grew by more than 18%, with digital now representing 41% of Lotteries turnover. Importantly, about half of the 2.5% increase in digital share came from the popularity of store syndicates online. These combined jackpot events and focused digital and retail initiatives were key drivers behind the above-model revenue outcome.","3  
combination of favourable H2 jackpot sequences, initiatives that were delivered and active game management.   Our revenue benefited from above model jackpot outcomes and we’ve estimated this impact to be approximately $250 million for the year. This had an EBITDA impact of around $50 million. This is allowing for some transference amongst games in the portfolios and some increase in our advertising costs.  In addition to the 9% Powerball increase and the 2% commission rate increase, Lotteries’ VC was favourably impacted by Set for Life interest revenue, a step up in our digital share in the second half of the year and a final step up in our Jumbo reseller arrangement.   Group OpEx increased by $29 million. Approximately $13 million of this increase was estimated as being attributable to separation, which is a combination of primarily technology labour and non-labour costs. Outside of the impact of separation, rising employment costs were the largest factor and this was due to pay increases, a reduction in our capitalisation rates, some increase in headcount and some additional reorganisation costs.   Advertising and promotion costs also rose during the course of the year, which was spend that was associated with the higher jackpots, the Keno rebrand and the launch of Weekday Windfall. There was also an increase in spend in relation to security and SaaS cloud applications, noting that 50% of our costs roughly are people related and technology costs now form approximately 30% of our total costs.  If we move now to slide 9, our capital allocation framework, this is a resilient business that generates strong and predictable cash flows, with low capital intensity and a highly variable cost base. This slide sets out how we think about allocating our capital to drive long-term shareholder value. We are focused on growing the top line and providing exceptional customer experiences and increasing our registered customer base.   We also remain focused on ensuring that we are well positioned for any potential licence extensions and maintaining value in the exclusive nature of our licences. Dividend payout ratio is targeted between 80% and 100% of full year net profit after tax pre significant items, with a long term leverage range of three to four times EBITDA. This reflects the underlying quality of the business and of our licences.   If we can move now to slide 10, our balance sheet provides flexibility in order for us to maximise returns for shareholders and this includes dividends, leveraged end of the year at 2.6 times, however this is more like 2.8 times in a normalised jackpot basis. If funds aren’t required for licences and there are not better returns available to us elsewhere, we|2  
 Finally, given the very strong result, the Company’s strong financial position and our focus on delivering shareholder returns, the Board was pleased to determine to pay a special dividend of $0.025 per share in addition to a full year ordinary dividend of $0.16 per share.  Slide 5 provides a reminder of the Company’s investment attributes, which have contributed to our strong FY24 performance. We are a business with a significant customer base, powerful brands, significant retail distribution, digital upside, strong cash flow generation and defensive qualities.   The resilience and historical growth of the lotteries and Keno market over the past two decades is demonstrated in the long term growth chart on slide 6. The consistent and growing demand for our products over time has established us as a market leader and one of the top performing lottery businesses globally.   I’ll now hand to Adam to take you through the next slides.  Mr Newman: Thanks Sue and good morning everyone. I’d like to highlight at the outset that while we’ve delivered strong top line growth, we’ve also delivered increase in our margins, we’ve been able to increase our registered customer base and we’ve also increased our dividend. This has all been despite the challenges of high inflation and rising interest rates.  Slide 7 gives us a snapshot of our FY24 Group results. These results benefited by the jackpot outcomes during the year with both revenue and VC up by approximately 14%. We also saw an increase in EBITDA of 16% and this was despite above average OpEx growth. Depreciation and amortisation rose 10% and this was primarily the impact of separation spend.   Interest expense declined $3 million and this was a combination of higher average debt and cash levels and increased interest rates during the course of the year. We are materially insulated from rising interest rates, given that about 85% of our debt is fixed. So whilst interest expense actually rose, this was more than offset by an increase in our interest income.   Net profit after tax but pre significant items of $412 million was an increase of 21% on the prior year. There were $2 million of significant items and this was a combination of the remaining separation costs, which were offset by receipts from the ATO tax settlement. We have provided further details on these in Appendix 1.   If we move now to slide 8 and, as Sue pointed out, turnover drove our record result, despite the OpEx pressures. EBITDA rose from $713 million to $827 million. The main drivers of this increase were a|5  
Ms van der Merwe: Thanks Adam. I’ll talk now to our business results and begin with Lotteries on slide 12. Lotteries revenue was up 14.7% and that was driven by active game and sequence management, highly favourable jackpot outcomes and positive impacts from the Powerball price increase and commission increase which I mentioned earlier. For Powerball, we deployed two sequences during the year to ensure a balanced spread of large jackpots, with the accelerated sequences helping to deliver the record $200 million draw, as well as the $150 million draw in May.  For Oz Lotto, we used a range of sequences which ultimately delivered a strong jackpot run to end the first half with the $90 million draw on Boxing Day. Base games were down 2% to 4% on a like for like basis in a weak consumer spending environment. The team deployed significant marketing activities to effectively leverage those big draws to retain and acquire customers and also to encourage reinvestment into other games.   A key attribute of our successful Lotteries business model is its mass participation across Australian adults. Slide 13 illustrates the continued growth in active registered customers, with a significant uplift of 12.2% in FY24, together with an increase in estimated total active customers to circa 10 million. These are important achievements as they provide opportunities to deliver greater personalisation and enhanced experiences to our customers.   In terms of channel performance, it was pleasing to see that retail turnover grew by 6.6%. Retail remains an important part of our offering, providing brand presence, customer convenience and support for a broad range of small businesses. Digital turnover grew by more than 18% in FY24. Store syndicates online continued to be very popular, with both customers and retailers and it accounted for around half of the 2.5% increase in digital share. All up, digital now accounts for 41% of our Lotteries turnover.  Turning to slide 14 and the breakdown between our jackpot and base games, we manage the business for overall growth and to maintain a healthy and balanced portfolio. The difference in mix that we see in FY24 was driven by the big jackpots. Against that backdrop, the resilience and demand for our portfolio of games was evident, with most base games, as we’ve said, only 2% to 4% down on a like for like basis and that was despite some transference of spend to Oz Lotto and Powerball.   On to slide 15, FY24 saw an unprecedented level of jackpots, with a 40.2% increase in the cumulative jackpot value offered across Powerball and Oz Lotto. This resulted in circa $500 million of additional turnover relative to model outcomes.",./dataset_2/pt3\The-Lottery-Corporation_FY24-Investor-Presentation-Transcript_August-2024.pdf
Assess the impact of record cumulative jackpots and digital syndicates on rare double-digit EBITDA growth.,,"Record cumulative jackpots had a significant positive impact on EBITDA growth, delivering about $250 million in additional revenue and around $50 million in incremental EBITDA for the year. These jackpot outcomes, alongside active game management, drove a 14% increase in both revenue and variable contribution (VC), with EBITDA rising 16% from $713 million to $827 million.

Additionally, digital syndicates contributed to digital turnover growth of more than 18% and accounted for about half of the 2.5% increase in digital share. Digital now makes up 41% of Lotteries turnover. This digital shift enabled greater customer engagement and contributed to the strong overall financial performance, supporting the rare double-digit EBITDA growth despite increased OpEx.","3

"Compare the drivers of digital vs. retail turnover growth in FY24, focusing on factors and turnover share.",,"In FY24, digital turnover grew by more than 18%, driven by strong uptake of store syndicates online (which accounted for about half of the 2.5% increase in digital share), effective marketing activities around large jackpots, and ongoing efforts to enhance digital engagement and experiences. Digital now represents 41% of Lotteries turnover.

Retail turnover grew by 6.6%, supported by retail’s role in brand presence, customer convenience, and supporting small businesses. While both channels benefited from mass participation and jackpot events, digital growth outpaced retail due to the shift in customer preference for online convenience and the popularity of digital store syndicates, whereas retail’s growth was steadier and tied to its established network and customer support.","3

"How do potential changes for Set for Life vs. Powerball compare in terms of timeline, research, and post-Saturday focus?",,"Set for Life and Powerball are likely the next games to be reviewed after changes to Saturday Lotto are complete. However, no specific timeline or details are available yet for innovations to Set for Life or Powerball. Extensive research will be conducted before any changes are decided or implemented, and the process is still in early stages, so more information will be provided further down the track. The team's current focus is on Saturday, with Set for Life or Powerball to follow.","10  
to understand what kind of innovation we could see over the next three years if possible.  Ms van der Merwe: Hi David. Yes, we’ve obviously indicated that we’re doing Saturday next and as we’ve spoken about before, we’re constantly looking at the portfolio of products and addressing a change in a game within the portfolio where we think it’s going to have the best result and responding to whatever’s happening in the portfolio at the time. I mean Powerball, that change has been an incredible success. It’s still delivering. It just delivered a one-in-seven-year event with the $200 million.   So we’re saying Set for Life or Powerball would likely be the next game that we would look at after Saturday, but I really can’t give you any flavour for what that would be. All of these changes we do extensive research on them before we decide on what the actual change will be and certainly before we implement it as well, so we’ve got a long way to go yet before we’re able to make any or provide any further detailed information on those changes.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) No, that’s understood, thank you. Then the next question, just thinking about leveraging cap management, obviously you’re sitting below the target range currently, I mean I guess we can expect the odd special dividend dependent on jackpot activity, but is there any consideration to move the dividend policy to adjust for cash earnings? So you’ve got that $35 million of non-cash licence amortisation each year, is there consideration to move to call it an NPATA payout ratio? Mr Newman: Hi David, Adam here. Look everything’s sort of, you know, we’re constantly evolving and looking at our framework that I talked about before. Nothing’s off the table, but at the moment that’s not a consideration. I think the first port of call that we’ll get through is the Victorian licence and when that renewal may arise and that will kind of shake out whether there’ll be any further changes with regards to the dividend framework that we’ve currently got at the moment.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Yes, okay, but to be clear, that Vic licence, I think, expires in 2028, right? So unless you can do it earlier, that would be something that would happen in 2027? Mr Newman: Yes, that’s correct, but I would also make the observation that there may be opportunities with regard – I don’t want to talk about specific licences in general, but as you can imagine, we’re always working with our government stakeholders with regards to all of our licences to see whether there are opportunities to evolve them.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Yes, okay, understood. All right, I’ll leave it there, thank you very much.|9  
Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Okay, great, thanks very much.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bradley Beckett with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Thank you, good morning Sue, good morning Adam. Just a question on the strategy. On slide 23 you talk to new revenue segments, can you give us a bit of a sense of your appetite here? Is that around digital instants or other gaming adjacencies?  Ms van der Merwe: Thanks Bradley, I’ll answer that in the first instance. We will unpack all of that further at investor day, as I said, but digital instants are banned in Australia under the Interactive Gambling Act, so it’s definitely not something that we’re looking at. Really is more around other opportunities for revenue growth. It could be other types of products, really not speculating on what it is, I think importantly, as we’ve always said, we are focused on our business and driving the performance of our domestic business in Australia whilst we look for other potential opportunities for earnings.  Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Great thank you. Just one more if I can. Maybe one for Adam on the cash conversion, looked a little bit lower versus FY23, can you give us a bit of a breakdown as to what’s driving that? Mr Newman: Yes, hi Bradley. This is a very cash generative business. Effectively cash conversion ebbs and flows a little bit and it’s driven by the timing and the size of draws as you approach the reporting periods in particular, being December and June and then what happened in the prior reporting period as well.   Where you’ve got a large jackpot in the last couple of weeks of a month where you’ve got a reporting period, you do get a buildup of payables and government taxes associated with that and they unwind in the next period. Then of course if you roll forward to the next year and if you haven’t got a similar jackpot coming up, that affects your cash conversion. We typically work off the fact that at in any given year cash conversion is going to be close to 100%.  Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Great, thank you.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Fabris with Macquarie. Please go ahead.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Good morning Sue, good morning Adam. Look I wanted to try and tease out a little bit more on game innovation. I can see on slide 24 you’ve given us a taste for the changes that are possible to FY27, can we maybe understand whether there’s going to be anything material to Set for Life or Powerball? I mean I recall that big Powerball change we saw maybe four, five years ago, just trying|8  
 While it’s early days, we are pleased with the start to the year. We’ve seen a stabilisation and some early signs of improvement in lottery sales for similar offers across the base games. Keno has continued its good momentum and tomorrow night’s $100 million draw has been reached in just five weeks on our accelerated sequence and sales to date are encouraging.   So as we conclude on slide 25, FY24 was a very successful year. Strong headline results and good use of the levers available to management drove growth. We continue to innovate and deliver against a proven plan, while also adapting to changes in the market and customer preferences. We are making positive impacts and we are operating in a way that delivers results for customers, shareholders, governments, small businesses and community.  That’s the end of our presentation. Thank you again for joining us this morning and we’re now happy to take questions.  Q&A Operator: Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star/one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star/two. If you are on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Today’s first question comes from Adrian Lemme with Citi. Please go ahead. Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Good morning Sue and Adam. My first question was just on the OpEx, so the way I understand it, there’s guidance of incremental $12 million from the incremental separation costs. Are we then right to then assume some further underlying inflation, I’m guessing 3% to 4% on top of that, or do you think you can offset it with any cost outs please? Mr Newman: Hi Adrian, it’s Adam here. You’re correct. I’d take our $300 million that we had for this year, I’d add the final step up, which is the run rate impact of the finalisation of separation and then take some inflation from there. I did point out that 50% of our costs are people and we have a 4% pay increase for FY25.  Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Great, that’s very clear, thank you Adam. Look my second question was about the Saturday lotto, I understand it might be early days, but are you able to give any further detail on what these game changes will be and when we might see them implemented please? Ms van der Merwe: Sure. Likely to involve a price increase and potentially some change to division 1. Unlikely to involve a change to the matrix of the game, but as you say, still early days and we’re still exploring the nature of that change and looking at the timing for implementation.",./dataset_2/pt3\The-Lottery-Corporation_FY24-Investor-Presentation-Transcript_August-2024.pdf
"How do FY24 jackpot timing, payables, and tax unwind impact cash conversion compared to FY23?",,"Cash conversion in FY24 was lower compared to FY23, mainly due to the timing and size of jackpot draws near reporting periods (December and June). Large jackpots late in a period lead to a buildup of payables and government taxes, which then unwind in the following period. If the subsequent year doesn't have similar jackpot activity in the same timeframe, it negatively impacts cash conversion for that year.","10  
to understand what kind of innovation we could see over the next three years if possible.  Ms van der Merwe: Hi David. Yes, we’ve obviously indicated that we’re doing Saturday next and as we’ve spoken about before, we’re constantly looking at the portfolio of products and addressing a change in a game within the portfolio where we think it’s going to have the best result and responding to whatever’s happening in the portfolio at the time. I mean Powerball, that change has been an incredible success. It’s still delivering. It just delivered a one-in-seven-year event with the $200 million.   So we’re saying Set for Life or Powerball would likely be the next game that we would look at after Saturday, but I really can’t give you any flavour for what that would be. All of these changes we do extensive research on them before we decide on what the actual change will be and certainly before we implement it as well, so we’ve got a long way to go yet before we’re able to make any or provide any further detailed information on those changes.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) No, that’s understood, thank you. Then the next question, just thinking about leveraging cap management, obviously you’re sitting below the target range currently, I mean I guess we can expect the odd special dividend dependent on jackpot activity, but is there any consideration to move the dividend policy to adjust for cash earnings? So you’ve got that $35 million of non-cash licence amortisation each year, is there consideration to move to call it an NPATA payout ratio? Mr Newman: Hi David, Adam here. Look everything’s sort of, you know, we’re constantly evolving and looking at our framework that I talked about before. Nothing’s off the table, but at the moment that’s not a consideration. I think the first port of call that we’ll get through is the Victorian licence and when that renewal may arise and that will kind of shake out whether there’ll be any further changes with regards to the dividend framework that we’ve currently got at the moment.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Yes, okay, but to be clear, that Vic licence, I think, expires in 2028, right? So unless you can do it earlier, that would be something that would happen in 2027? Mr Newman: Yes, that’s correct, but I would also make the observation that there may be opportunities with regard – I don’t want to talk about specific licences in general, but as you can imagine, we’re always working with our government stakeholders with regards to all of our licences to see whether there are opportunities to evolve them.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Yes, okay, understood. All right, I’ll leave it there, thank you very much.|9  
Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Okay, great, thanks very much.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bradley Beckett with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Thank you, good morning Sue, good morning Adam. Just a question on the strategy. On slide 23 you talk to new revenue segments, can you give us a bit of a sense of your appetite here? Is that around digital instants or other gaming adjacencies?  Ms van der Merwe: Thanks Bradley, I’ll answer that in the first instance. We will unpack all of that further at investor day, as I said, but digital instants are banned in Australia under the Interactive Gambling Act, so it’s definitely not something that we’re looking at. Really is more around other opportunities for revenue growth. It could be other types of products, really not speculating on what it is, I think importantly, as we’ve always said, we are focused on our business and driving the performance of our domestic business in Australia whilst we look for other potential opportunities for earnings.  Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Great thank you. Just one more if I can. Maybe one for Adam on the cash conversion, looked a little bit lower versus FY23, can you give us a bit of a breakdown as to what’s driving that? Mr Newman: Yes, hi Bradley. This is a very cash generative business. Effectively cash conversion ebbs and flows a little bit and it’s driven by the timing and the size of draws as you approach the reporting periods in particular, being December and June and then what happened in the prior reporting period as well.   Where you’ve got a large jackpot in the last couple of weeks of a month where you’ve got a reporting period, you do get a buildup of payables and government taxes associated with that and they unwind in the next period. Then of course if you roll forward to the next year and if you haven’t got a similar jackpot coming up, that affects your cash conversion. We typically work off the fact that at in any given year cash conversion is going to be close to 100%.  Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Great, thank you.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Fabris with Macquarie. Please go ahead.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Good morning Sue, good morning Adam.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohan Sundram with MST Financial. Please go ahead. Mr Sundram: (MST Financial, Analyst) Thank you, hi Sue and Adam. Sue, just one for you to begin with. I take on board your comments earlier around the Federal Government’s review into the offshore lottery providers and online Keno, but how would you describe the response that you’ve seen thus far? Is it pleasing? Is it in line with what you were hoping to see from the government initially? Ms van der Merwe: We welcome that review by the Federal Government, including the review into online Keno. We acknowledge that online Keno in particular has a higher risk profile certainly than lotteries, which has a very low-harm profile. I think if the government’s going to review the industry and the impact on Australians from the gambling industry, then it makes sense that foreign matched lottery products is included in that. So we welcome the review, we will obviously be making a submission and cooperate with government in discussions.  Mr Sundram: (MST Financial, Analyst) Okay, thank you. One for Adam. Adam, I take on board your comments around the 4% increase in labour costs, but on the other portion of your costs, the other 50%, how would you describe the inflation pressures at present? Mr Newman: Yes, look, how would I describe the other pressures, there’s probably a little bit more than your typical run of the mill inflation and technology costs. Other than that, I think wage inflation and inflation for other parts of the cost base are probably running in a similar line.  Mr Sundram: (MST Financial, Analyst) Okay, thank you.

Evaluate why the $500M turnover from FY24’s above-trend jackpot only yielded $250M in revenue.,,"The $500 million turnover from FY24’s above-trend jackpot refers to the total amount wagered (or ticket sales), while the $250 million revenue reflects the portion retained by the company after prize payouts and other associated costs.

Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Okay, great, thanks very much.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Bradley Beckett with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Thank you, good morning Sue, good morning Adam. Just a question on the strategy. On slide 23 you talk to new revenue segments, can you give us a bit of a sense of your appetite here? Is that around digital instants or other gaming adjacencies?  Ms van der Merwe: Thanks Bradley, I’ll answer that in the first instance. We will unpack all of that further at investor day, as I said, but digital instants are banned in Australia under the Interactive Gambling Act, so it’s definitely not something that we’re looking at. Really is more around other opportunities for revenue growth. It could be other types of products, really not speculating on what it is, I think importantly, as we’ve always said, we are focused on our business and driving the performance of our domestic business in Australia whilst we look for other potential opportunities for earnings.  Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Great thank you. Just one more if I can. Maybe one for Adam on the cash conversion, looked a little bit lower versus FY23, can you give us a bit of a breakdown as to what’s driving that? Mr Newman: Yes, hi Bradley. This is a very cash generative business. Effectively cash conversion ebbs and flows a little bit and it’s driven by the timing and the size of draws as you approach the reporting periods in particular, being December and June and then what happened in the prior reporting period as well.   Where you’ve got a large jackpot in the last couple of weeks of a month where you’ve got a reporting period, you do get a buildup of payables and government taxes associated with that and they unwind in the next period. Then of course if you roll forward to the next year and if you haven’t got a similar jackpot coming up, that affects your cash conversion. We typically work off the fact that at in any given year cash conversion is going to be close to 100%.  Mr Beckett: (UBS, Analyst) Great, thank you.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Fabris with Macquarie. Please go ahead.  Mr Fabris: (Macquarie Group, Analyst) Good morning Sue, good morning Adam. Look I wanted to try and tease out a little bit more on game innovation. I can see on slide 24 you’ve given us a taste for the changes that are possible to FY27, can we maybe understand whether there’s going to be anything material to Set for Life or Powerball? I mean I recall that big Powerball change we saw maybe four, five years ago, just trying",./dataset_2/pt3\The-Lottery-Corporation_FY24-Investor-Presentation-Transcript_August-2024.pdf
How do proposed Sat. lotto changes compare to previous Powerball updates in scope and timing?,,"The proposed Saturday lotto changes are likely to involve a price increase and a potential change to division 1, but are unlikely to change the game matrix. These changes are still in early stages and the timing for implementation is yet to be determined. In comparison, the previous Powerball update (which occurred four or five years ago) was noted as a significant change, but there is no indication that the Saturday lotto changes will be as material or wide-ranging as that Powerball update. Overall, the scope of Saturday lotto changes appears more limited, and details on timing are still being explored.","11  
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rohan Sundram with MST Financial. Please go ahead. Mr Sundram: (MST Financial, Analyst) Thank you, hi Sue and Adam. Sue, just one for you to begin with. I take on board your comments earlier around the Federal Government’s review into the offshore lottery providers and online Keno, but how would you describe the response that you’ve seen thus far? Is it pleasing? Is it in line with what you were hoping to see from the government initially? Ms van der Merwe: We welcome that review by the Federal Government, including the review into online Keno. We acknowledge that online Keno in particular has a higher risk profile certainly than lotteries, which has a very low-harm profile. I think if the government’s going to review the industry and the impact on Australians from the gambling industry, then it makes sense that foreign matched lottery products is included in that. So we welcome the review, we will obviously be making a submission and cooperate with government in discussions.  Mr Sundram: (MST Financial, Analyst) Okay, thank you. One for Adam. Adam, I take on board your comments around the 4% increase in labour costs, but on the other portion of your costs, the other 50%, how would you describe the inflation pressures at present? Mr Newman: Yes, look, how would I describe the other pressures, there’s probably a little bit more than your typical run of the mill inflation and technology costs. Other than that, I think wage inflation and inflation for other parts of the cost base are probably running in a similar line.  Mr Sundram: (MST Financial, Analyst) Okay, thank you.  Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Rohan Gallagher with Jarden Group. Please go ahead. Mr Gallagher: (Jarden Group, Analyst) Hey Sue, hey Adam, good morning everybody. My earlier question has been answered, but just to clarify, Adam, in your prepared remarks you said that there was a $250 million benefit from the above-trend jackpot, but in the written materials it’s saying $500 million. I just want to just clarify the additional turnover in FY24 received. Mr Newman: Yes, so no, I was calling out the revenue impact. So the $500 million is the turnover impact and the $250 million is the revenue impact.  Mr Gallagher: (Jarden Group, Analyst) Outstanding, thank you sir, cheers. Operator: Thank you. Our next question today is a follow up from Adrian Lemme with Citi. Please go ahead. Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Look thanks for taking a follow-up question. I was just interested with the extraordinary activity around the $200 million|8  
 While it’s early days, we are pleased with the start to the year. We’ve seen a stabilisation and some early signs of improvement in lottery sales for similar offers across the base games. Keno has continued its good momentum and tomorrow night’s $100 million draw has been reached in just five weeks on our accelerated sequence and sales to date are encouraging.   So as we conclude on slide 25, FY24 was a very successful year. Strong headline results and good use of the levers available to management drove growth. We continue to innovate and deliver against a proven plan, while also adapting to changes in the market and customer preferences. We are making positive impacts and we are operating in a way that delivers results for customers, shareholders, governments, small businesses and community.  That’s the end of our presentation. Thank you again for joining us this morning and we’re now happy to take questions.  Q&A Operator: Thank you. If you wish to ask a question, please press star/one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press star/two. If you are on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset to ask your question. Today’s first question comes from Adrian Lemme with Citi. Please go ahead. Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Good morning Sue and Adam. My first question was just on the OpEx, so the way I understand it, there’s guidance of incremental $12 million from the incremental separation costs. Are we then right to then assume some further underlying inflation, I’m guessing 3% to 4% on top of that, or do you think you can offset it with any cost outs please? Mr Newman: Hi Adrian, it’s Adam here. You’re correct. I’d take our $300 million that we had for this year, I’d add the final step up, which is the run rate impact of the finalisation of separation and then take some inflation from there. I did point out that 50% of our costs are people and we have a 4% pay increase for FY25.  Mr Lemme: (Citi, Analyst) Great, that’s very clear, thank you Adam. Look my second question was about the Saturday lotto, I understand it might be early days, but are you able to give any further detail on what these game changes will be and when we might see them implemented please? Ms van der Merwe: Sure. Likely to involve a price increase and potentially some change to division 1. Unlikely to involve a change to the matrix of the game, but as you say, still early days and we’re still exploring the nature of that change and looking at the timing for implementation.|9

"Explain how Musk's risk-reward 2018 CEO Award structure spurred Tesla to outperform rival techs in value, TSR, and revenue.",,"The 2018 CEO Performance Award given to Elon Musk was structured purely on a “risk vs. reward” basis—Musk would receive compensation only if highly ambitious targets were met, which many thought impossible at the time. This alignment of Musk’s interests with those of shareholders incentivized him to achieve extraordinary results for Tesla.

As a direct result, Tesla generated over $735 billion in market value, delivered approximately 1,100% total stockholder returns (TSR), and outperformed leading tech companies like NVIDIA, Apple, and Amazon in revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA growth, and TSR between 2018 and 2023. Simply put: Musk’s compensation was directly tied to value creation, driving him to deliver exceptional performance for stockholders and propelling Tesla ahead of its tech peers.","The	$44.9	billion	figure	is	the	result	of	the	extraordinary	growth	and	value	creation	generated	through	Elon’s	leadership	and	vision,	hitting	highly	ambitious	targets	that	the	2018	CEO	Performance	Award	incentivized	and	motivated	him	to	achieve.	In	2018,	many	commentators	thought	the	value	of	the	Award	would	never	ultimately	be	awarded	to	Elon	because	the	requisite	performance	targets	were	simply	impossible	to	hit.	From	an	economic	and	accounting	perspective,	the	fair	value	(i.e.,	the	best	estimate	of	the	cost	of	the	Award	to	stockholders)	was	determined	to	be	$2.3	billion.	In	exchange	for	this	$2.3	billion	non-cash	accounting	expense,	Tesla’s	stockholders	have	been	rewarded	with	extraordinary	market	value	appreciation	of	over	$735	billion1	and	~1,100%2	total	stockholder	returns.	The	company	has	outperformed	other	value-generative	tech	companies,	including	NVIDIA,	Apple	and	Amazon	in	terms	of	revenue	growth,	adjusted	EBITDA	growth	and	TSR3	over	the	period	from	2018	to	2023.	The	value	of	the	Award	today	is	directly	proportionate	to	the	tremendous	value	that	Elon	created	for	stockholders.	If	stockholders	had	seen	zero	value	creation	over	the	past	six	years,	then	Elon	would	have	received	zero	compensation	–	the	Award	was	designed	so	that	Elon	only	benefited	if	stockholders	did.	03	Glass	Lewis	says…	”With	regard	to	the	grant	date	value	as	estimated	by	Glass	Lewis	at	$3.7	billion	and	reported	by	the	Company	at	$2.6	billion,	the	retentive	effect	for	Mr.	Musk	is	clear,	but	whether	it	needed	to	be	at	such	a	level	is	arguable.”	The	FACT	is…	This	is	pure	speculation.	Glass	Lewis	is	attempting	to	substitute	its	musings	and	desires	for	the	business	judgment	of	the	Board,	which	was	advised	by	an	independent,	widely-recognized	compensation	consultant.	Glass	Lewis	may	speculate	that	some	other	compensation	arrangement	may	have	been	available	and	may	have	achieved	a	similar	result,	but	the	fact	is	that	the	Award	as	designed,	was	the	one	that	the	Board	determined
(and	stockholders	agreed)	was	appropriate	to	accomplish	its	objectives.	Importantly,	with	the	benefit	of	hindsight,	the	Award	as	designed	worked	beautifully	to	incentivize	Elon	to	create	value.	Why	speculate	about	whether	some	other	structure	could	have	generated	equivalent	value-creation	for	stockholders?	Speculation	in	hindsight	about	other	compensation	structures	does	nothing	to	help	Tesla	or	its	stockholders	with	the	current	problem,	which	is	that	a	promise	that	was	made	in	good	faith	by	the	company	and	its	stockholders	to	Elon	has	been	rescinded	by	a	court.	There	is	no	opportunity	now	to	re-imagine	the	original	deal.	Either	stockholders	support	the	company	and	its	promise	to	Elon	or	they	do	not.	There	is	not	a	third	way.	04	Glass	Lewis	says…	“...the	shares	held	by	Mr.	Musk	in	2018,	excluding	options	that	had	yet	to	be	exercised	(based	on	the	beneficial	owners	table	included	in	the	proxy	statement	filed	on	April	26,	2018)	saw	their	value	increase	from	approximately	$11.8	billion	on	the	date	of	grant	of	the	2018	CEO	Performance	Award	to	$81.5	billion	as	of	the	record	date	for	this	annual	general	meeting.”	The	FACT	is…	Glass	Lewis	is	quick	to	point	out	how	much	the	value	of	Elon’s	shares	increased,	without	recognizing	that	his	value	was	increasing	because	the	stock	increased	significantly	in	value,	creating	wealth	for	all	Tesla	stockholders.	Glass	Lewis	does	not	even	mention	once	in	its	71-page	report	the	tremendous	value	created	for	Tesla	stockholders	–	over	$735	billion1	–	in	less	than	six	years.

“[I]f	a	court	determines	that	such	litigation	has	merit,	the	Company	may	be	required	to	pay	substantial	monetary	damages.”	The	FACT	is…	This	is	scaremongering.	Any	such	litigation	would	be	meritless	because	stockholders’	rights	in	Texas	are	substantially	equivalent,	and	Glass	Lewis	doesn’t	think	and	didn’t	conclude	otherwise.	Nor	is	there	any	basis	to	hypothesize	about	monetary	damages	in	litigation.	As	the	Special	Committee	and	its	financial	advisor	found,	there	is	no	reason	to	think	moving	to	Texas	would	have	any	impact	to	Tesla’s	market	value	–	and	therefore	there	would	be	no	monetary	damages.	Microsoft	didn’t	have	to	pay	any	monetary	damages	when	it	moved	from	Delaware	to	Washington.	Stockholders	should	not	be	encouraged	to	make	the	wrong	decision	about	redomestication	on	the	basis	that	the	right	decision	could	result	in	frivolous	litigation.	With	respect	to	Proposal	4,	the	ratification	of	the	2018	CEO	Performance	Award	01	Glass	Lewis	says…	Rescinding	the	Award,	and	paying	Mr.	Musk	nothing,	is	acceptable	because	it	was	always	possible	that	the	Award	would	result	in	no	payout	(if	performance	targets	were	not	achieved),	so	Mr.	Musk	and	the	company	should	have	anticipated	that	he	might	work	for	no	compensation	for	six	years.	The	FACT	is…	This	is	absurd.	That	Tesla	and	Elon	agreed	on	a	compensation	package	that	was	fundamentally	based	on	a	“risk	vs	reward”	framework	simply	cannot	be	the	basis	for	reneging	on	the	“reward”	after	the	fact.	Elon	took	a	bold	and	tremendous	bet	on	his	own	ability	to	perform	and	achieve	extraordinary	results.	He	never	expected	that	the	bargain	he	struck	would	be	rescinded	by	a	court	despite	strong	stockholder	support.	Elon	was	fully	prepared	to	earn	nothing	if	he	failed	stockholders.	But,	he	did	not	fail	stockholders.	He	delivered.	In	fact,	he	delivered	more	value	than	expected	in	half	the	time	allotted.	Elon	hit	the	targets	that	were	anticipated	and	did	create	extraordinary	growth	and	stockholder	returns.
Receiving	no	compensation	whatsoever	in	return	for	achieving	exceptional	results	for	Tesla	and	its	stockholders	was	never	part	of	the	deal.	Tesla	believes	it	should	abide	by	its	commitment	to	Elon	as	Elon	delivered	on	this	commitment	to	Tesla.	A	deal	is	a	deal.	That	is	the	fair	and	ethical	thing	to	do.	02	Glass	Lewis	says…	“While	such	value	being	delivered	to	Mr.	Musk	is	still	contingent	on	other	factors…the	$44.9	billion	currently	associated	with	the	award	is	nonetheless	concerning.”	The	FACT	is…	This	is	circular	reasoning.|Elon	has	an	extraordinary	amount	of	“skin	in	the	game,”	which	is	exactly	what	governance	advisors	like	Glass	Lewis	typically	ask	of	executives.	His	interests	are	100%	aligned	with	stockholders’.	05	Glass	Lewis	says…	“However,	other	considerations	regarding	Mr.	Musk's	time	commitments	to	the	Company	may	continue	to	warrant	consideration	in	the	current	moment	and	highlight	weakness	in	the	award	at	achieving	adequate	levels	of	executive	focus.”	The	FACT	is…	This	concern	simply	ignores	the	facts.	Tesla	created	over	$735	billion1	of	market	value	for	stockholders	from	2018	to	2023	because	Elon	helped	Tesla	achieve	performance	targets	that	were	regarded	by	many	as	extremely	difficult	or	impossible.	Elon	has	acknowledged	on	the	record	that	the	2018	Performance	Award	incentivized	and	motivated	him	to	help	Tesla	achieve	this	extraordinary	growth.	Glass	Lewis	may	believe	that	Elon	should	have	done	so	with	more	“focus,”	but	the	fact	is	that	Tesla’s	performance	speaks	for	itself.	Stockholders	should	care	enormously	about	value	creation	(which	Glass	Lewis	inexplicably	ignores),	and	not	about	whether	Elon’s	perceived	“focus”	was	strong	enough.

The award’s value, ultimately $44.9 billion, is proportionate to this extraordinary shareholder value creation, ensuring Elon's interests were fully aligned with those of stockholders.

Elon	took	a	bold	and	tremendous	bet	on	his	own	ability	to	perform	and	achieve	extraordinary	results.	He	never	expected	that	the	bargain	he	struck	would	be	rescinded	by	a	court	despite	strong	stockholder	support.	Elon	was	fully	prepared	to	earn	nothing	if	he	failed	stockholders.	But,	he	did	not	fail	stockholders.	He	delivered.	In	fact,	he	delivered	more	value	than	expected	in	half	the	time	allotted.	Elon	hit	the	targets	that	were	anticipated	and	did	create	extraordinary	growth	and	stockholder	returns.
Receiving	no	compensation	whatsoever	in	return	for	achieving	exceptional	results	for	Tesla	and	its	stockholders	was	never	part	of	the	deal.	Tesla	believes	it	should	abide	by	its	commitment	to	Elon	as	Elon	delivered	on	this	commitment	to	Tesla.	A	deal	is	a	deal.

Tesla	created	over	$735	billion1	of	market	value	for	stockholders	from	2018	to	2023	because	Elon	helped	Tesla	achieve	performance	targets	that	were	regarded	by	many	as	extremely	difficult	or	impossible.

"Analyze Tesla’s responses to Glass Lewis’s compensation/value/focus criticisms regarding Musk, linking to stockholder returns.",,"Tesla’s responses to Glass Lewis’s criticisms emphasize that Elon Musk’s 2018 CEO Performance Award directly incentivized the extraordinary value creation and stockholder returns achieved between 2018 and 2023. Tesla points out that, in exchange for a $2.3 billion accounting expense, stockholders realized over $735 billion in market value appreciation and ~1,100% total returns—outperforming tech peers like NVIDIA, Apple, and Amazon.

Tesla rebuts concerns over the $44.9 billion value of the award by arguing that Musk’s compensation is proportionate to the unprecedented results delivered for stockholders, highlighting the ""risk vs reward"" nature of the original agreement. They argue that speculating on alternative compensation structures is pointless given that the actual award “worked beautifully” in practice.

Regarding focus, Tesla dismisses Glass Lewis’s concerns about Musk’s time commitment, citing the objective results: significant achievement of what were considered nearly impossible performance targets and exceptional company growth. Tesla maintains that Musk’s interests are fully aligned with stockholders due to his massive personal stake, and contends that value creation—not the subjective perception of executive focus—should be the priority.

In summary, Tesla responds to criticism by directly connecting Musk’s incentivized leadership to billions in stockholder value, asserting that the compensation was both justified and effective.","The	$44.9	billion	figure	is	the	result	of	the	extraordinary	growth	and	value	creation	generated	through	Elon’s	leadership	and	vision,	hitting	highly	ambitious	targets	that	the	2018	CEO	Performance	Award	incentivized	and	motivated	him	to	achieve.	In	2018,	many	commentators	thought	the	value	of	the	Award	would	never	ultimately	be	awarded	to	Elon	because	the	requisite	performance	targets	were	simply	impossible	to	hit.	From	an	economic	and	accounting	perspective,	the	fair	value	(i.e.,	the	best	estimate	of	the	cost	of	the	Award	to	stockholders)	was	determined	to	be	$2.3	billion.	In	exchange	for	this	$2.3	billion	non-cash	accounting	expense,	Tesla’s	stockholders	have	been	rewarded	with	extraordinary	market	value	appreciation	of	over	$735	billion1	and	~1,100%2	total	stockholder	returns.	The	company	has	outperformed	other	value-generative	tech	companies,	including	NVIDIA,	Apple	and	Amazon	in	terms	of	revenue	growth,	adjusted	EBITDA	growth	and	TSR3	over	the	period	from	2018	to	2023.	The	value	of	the	Award	today	is	directly	proportionate	to	the	tremendous	value	that	Elon	created	for	stockholders.	If	stockholders	had	seen	zero	value	creation	over	the	past	six	years,	then	Elon	would	have	received	zero	compensation	–	the	Award	was	designed	so	that	Elon	only	benefited	if	stockholders	did.	03	Glass	Lewis	says…	”With	regard	to	the	grant	date	value	as	estimated	by	Glass	Lewis	at	$3.7	billion	and	reported	by	the	Company	at	$2.6	billion,	the	retentive	effect	for	Mr.	Musk	is	clear,	but	whether	it	needed	to	be	at	such	a	level	is	arguable.”	The	FACT	is…	This	is	pure	speculation.	Glass	Lewis	is	attempting	to	substitute	its	musings	and	desires	for	the	business	judgment	of	the	Board,	which	was	advised	by	an	independent,	widely-recognized	compensation	consultant.	Glass	Lewis	may	speculate	that	some	other	compensation	arrangement	may	have	been	available	and	may	have	achieved	a	similar	result,	but	the	fact	is	that	the	Award	as	designed,	was	the	one	that	the	Board	determined
(and	stockholders	agreed)	was	appropriate	to	accomplish	its	objectives.	Importantly,	with	the	benefit	of	hindsight,	the	Award	as	designed	worked	beautifully	to	incentivize	Elon	to	create	value.	Why	speculate	about	whether	some	other	structure	could	have	generated	equivalent	value-creation	for	stockholders?	Speculation	in	hindsight	about	other	compensation	structures	does	nothing	to	help	Tesla	or	its	stockholders	with	the	current	problem,	which	is	that	a	promise	that	was	made	in	good	faith	by	the	company	and	its	stockholders	to	Elon	has	been	rescinded	by	a	court.	There	is	no	opportunity	now	to	re-imagine	the	original	deal.	Either	stockholders	support	the	company	and	its	promise	to	Elon	or	they	do	not.	There	is	not	a	third	way.	04	Glass	Lewis	says…	“...the	shares	held	by	Mr.	Musk	in	2018,	excluding	options	that	had	yet	to	be	exercised	(based	on	the	beneficial	owners	table	included	in	the	proxy	statement	filed	on	April	26,	2018)	saw	their	value	increase	from	approximately	$11.8	billion	on	the	date	of	grant	of	the	2018	CEO	Performance	Award	to	$81.5	billion	as	of	the	record	date	for	this	annual	general	meeting.”	The	FACT	is…	Glass	Lewis	is	quick	to	point	out	how	much	the	value	of	Elon’s	shares	increased,	without	recognizing	that	his	value	was	increasing	because	the	stock	increased	significantly	in	value,	creating	wealth	for	all	Tesla	stockholders.	Glass	Lewis	does	not	even	mention	once	in	its	71-page	report	the	tremendous	value	created	for	Tesla	stockholders	–	over	$735	billion1	–	in	less	than	six	years.	Elon	led	Tesla	to	outperform	key	indices	and	other	value-generative	tech	companies,	including	NVIDIA,	Apple	and	Amazon	in	terms	of	revenue	growth,	adjusted	EBITDA	growth	and	TSR3	over	the	period	from	2018	to	2023.|04	Glass	Lewis	says…	
“[I]f	a	court	determines	that	such	litigation	has	merit,	the	Company	may	be	required	to	pay	substantial	monetary	damages.”	The	FACT	is…	This	is	scaremongering.	Any	such	litigation	would	be	meritless	because	stockholders’	rights	in	Texas	are	substantially	equivalent,	and	Glass	Lewis	doesn’t	think	and	didn’t	conclude	otherwise.	Nor	is	there	any	basis	to	hypothesize	about	monetary	damages	in	litigation.	As	the	Special	Committee	and	its	financial	advisor	found,	there	is	no	reason	to	think	moving	to	Texas	would	have	any	impact	to	Tesla’s	market	value	–	and	therefore	there	would	be	no	monetary	damages.	Microsoft	didn’t	have	to	pay	any	monetary	damages	when	it	moved	from	Delaware	to	Washington.	Stockholders	should	not	be	encouraged	to	make	the	wrong	decision	about	redomestication	on	the	basis	that	the	right	decision	could	result	in	frivolous	litigation.	With	respect	to	Proposal	4,	the	ratification	of	the	2018	CEO	Performance	Award	01	Glass	Lewis	says…	Rescinding	the	Award,	and	paying	Mr.	Musk	nothing,	is	acceptable	because	it	was	always	possible	that	the	Award	would	result	in	no	payout	(if	performance	targets	were	not	achieved),	so	Mr.	Musk	and	the	company	should	have	anticipated	that	he	might	work	for	no	compensation	for	six	years.	The	FACT	is…	This	is	absurd.	That	Tesla	and	Elon	agreed	on	a	compensation	package	that	was	fundamentally	based	on	a	“risk	vs	reward”	framework	simply	cannot	be	the	basis	for	reneging	on	the	“reward”	after	the	fact.	Elon	took	a	bold	and	tremendous	bet	on	his	own	ability	to	perform	and	achieve	extraordinary	results.	He	never	expected	that	the	bargain	he	struck	would	be	rescinded	by	a	court	despite	strong	stockholder	support.	Elon	was	fully	prepared	to	earn	nothing	if	he	failed	stockholders.	But,	he	did	not	fail	stockholders.	He	delivered.	In	fact,	he	delivered	more	value	than	expected	in	half	the	time	allotted.

Dear Fellow U. S. Steel Stockholders,
With our Annual Meeting of Stockholders (“Annual Meeting”) approaching on May 6, 2025, we are writing   
to thank you for your feedback and continued support of U. S. Steel and of us, your Board of Directors. 
During the past several weeks, our conversations with you have made it clear that there is strong support for 
the Board’s strategy and completing the value-maximizing agreement with Nippon Steel to deliver $55 per 
share in cash for stockholders. We are pleased that the U.S. government announced a new review by the 
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and that Ancora abandoned its campaign to change 
U. S. Steel’s Board, acknowledging that consummating a partnership with, and securing the accompanying 
investment from, Nippon Steel would constitute the best outcome for stockholders. 1 
The Board and management team have transformed U. S. Steel into a modern, innovative steel producer 
through the diligent execution of a bold strategy and balanced approach to capital allocation. As a result of 
our actions, we have a diversified portfolio with integrated mini mills and blast furnace capabilities that has 
resulted in superior financial performance, including a ~20% increase in revenue from 2019 to 2024 and a 
~28% increase in revenue per ton of shipments from 2019 to 2024, against the backdrop of a difficult macro 
steel market in 2024.2 This transformation is also what attracted significant interest from multiple potential 
bidders, culminating in the 142% premium 3 offer from Nippon Steel.
We are confident that together with Nippon Steel, we will propel U. S. Steel into the future through significant 
capital investments that will enhance the Company’s domestic production and manufacturing capabilities 
and the introduction of world-leading technologies to deliver superior products, all of which will create and 
protect American production and jobs. The Board remains steadfast in its commitment to complete the 
partnership with Nippon Steel  to maximize stockholder value and enhance U.S. national security as well as 
support a stronger American steel industry for generations to come.
You can count on this Board to continue taking actions that are in the best interests of U. S. Steel and our 
stockholders. To that end, your vote “FOR” all of our 10 highly qualified director nominees and the four other 
proposals contained in our proxy statement is important and shows support for the actions your Board has 
taken to maximize stockholder value.
We greatly appreciate the trust you have placed in our Board and your continued support as we work  
to secure a bright future for our Company and the American steel industry. 
Sincerely,
The U. S. Steel Board of Directors

Forward-Looking Statements
This communication contains information regarding the Company that may 
constitute “forward-looking statements,” as that term is defined under the 
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other securities laws, that 
are subject to risks and uncertainties. We intend the forward-looking statements 
to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in 
those sections. Generally, we have identified such forward-looking statements 
by using the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” 
“target,” “forecast,” “aim,” “should,” “plan,” “goal,” “future,” “will,” “may” and 
similar expressions or by using future dates in connection with any discussion 
of, among other things, statements expressing general views about future 
operating or financial results, operating or financial performance, trends, events 
or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, anticipated 
cost savings, potential capital and operational cash improvements and changes 
in the global economic environment, anticipated capital expenditures, the 
construction or operation of new or existing facilities or capabilities and the 
costs associated with such matters, statements regarding our greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction goals, as well as statements regarding the merger between 
the Company and Nippon Steel Corporation (the “Transaction”), including the 
timing of the completion of the Transaction. However, the absence of these words 
or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. 
Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts, 
but instead represent only the Company’s beliefs regarding future goals, plans 
and expectations about our prospects for the future and other events, many of 
which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Company’s 
control. It is possible that the Company’s actual results and financial condition 
may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial 
condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Management of the 
Company believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable 
as of the time made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue 
reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements 
speak only as of the date when made. In addition, forward looking statements 
are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results 
to differ materially from the Company’s historical experience and our present 
expectations or projections. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation: 
the ability of the parties to consummate the Transaction on a timely basis or at 
all; the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give 
rise to the termination of the definitive agreement and plan of merger relating 
to the Transaction (the “Merger Agreement”); risks arising from litigation related 
to the Transaction, either brought by or against the parties; the risk that the 
parties to the Merger Agreement may not be able to satisfy the conditions to 
the consummation of the Transaction in a timely manner or at all; risks related 
to disruption of management time from ongoing business operations due to 
the Transaction and related litigation; certain restrictions during the pendency 
of the Transaction that may impact the Company’s ability to pursue certain 
business opportunities or strategic transactions; the risk that any announcements 
relating to the Transaction could have adverse effects on the market price of 
the Company’s common stock; the risk of any unexpected costs or expenses 
resulting from the Transaction; the risk that the Transaction and its announcement 
could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Company to retain customers 
and retain and hire key personnel and maintain relationships with customers, 
suppliers, employees, stockholders and other business relationships and on its 
operating results and business generally; and the risk the pending Transaction 
could distract management of the Company. The Company directs readers to 
Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 
2024, and the other documents it files with the SEC for other risks associated 
with the Company’s future performance. These documents contain and identify 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those 
contained in the forward-looking statements. All information in this report is as 
of the date above. The Company does not undertake any duty to update any 
forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes 
in the Company’s expectations whether as a result of new information, future 
events or otherwise, except as required by law. References to (i) “U. S. Steel,” the 
“Corporation,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to United States Steel 
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated by the 
context.

Enumerate rare legal or regulatory hurdles in cross-border steel mergers and their effects on board continuity.,,"Rare legal or regulatory hurdles in cross-border steel mergers can include national security reviews, foreign investment restrictions, antitrust investigations in multiple jurisdictions, and specific sectoral regulations unique to the steel industry. These hurdles may delay or prevent completion of the merger, lead to required divestitures, or impose operational restrictions. As noted in the context, risks such as the failure to satisfy closing conditions, litigation related to the transaction, or required regulatory approvals can disrupt management and board activities, potentially affecting board continuity through increased turnover or distraction of directors from ongoing business oversight during the pendency of the transaction.","YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT!

Analyze rare legal and market repercussions of failed cross-border steel industry mergers.,,"Failed cross-border steel industry mergers can have several rare but significant legal and market repercussions. Legally, failed mergers may lead to complex, multi-jurisdictional litigation between the parties involved, especially if there are disputes over termination of the merger agreement or alleged breaches—potentially resulting in damages, penalties, or injunctions. Regulatory bodies in multiple countries might scrutinize not just the merger itself, but also potential antitrust or national security issues revealed during the process, possibly leading to future restrictions on similar deals.

In the market, the announcement and subsequent failure of a major steel merger can adversely impact the share price of the involved companies due to investor uncertainty, as noted in the context regarding risks of “adverse effects on the market price of the Company’s common stock.” It may also disrupt business operations, affect management time, and influence relationships with employees, customers, and suppliers, sometimes resulting in lost business opportunities or increased costs. Finally, failed high-profile mergers can discourage future foreign investment in the industry, especially if the failure is due to regulatory or political challenges.","YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT!
