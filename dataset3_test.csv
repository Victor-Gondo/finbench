Compare drivers of GM Financial’s 14% YoY lease income growth with changes in loan origination trends.,,"GM Financial’s lease income grew 14% year-over-year in Q1 2024 ($1.8B vs. $1.8B, rounded for both periods), driven primarily by higher lease volumes and increased lease receipts rather than significant changes in residual values or subvention. This growth contrasts with loan origination trends, where GM Financial’s U.S. retail penetration dropped to 40% from 46% and prime loan originations as a percentage of total North America loan originations decreased to 79% from 83%. This indicates that although total financing activity was less concentrated in prime loans and direct GM penetration declined, leasing remained an area of steady or increased growth for GM Financial, likely reflecting consumer or dealer preference shifts toward lease products over traditional loans.","Table of Contents

GM Financial We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental
GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 40% in
the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 46% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs
available and competing third-party financing products in the market. GM Financial's prime loan originations as a percentage of total loan originations in
North America decreased to 79% in the three months ended March 31, 2024 from 83% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the three months ended
March 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 47%, retail finance charge income of 39% and commercial finance charge
income of 7%.
GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Gains on terminations of leased
vehicles of $0.2 billion were included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. The

"Analyze how vehicle title collateralization grants GM Financial remedies, including repossession, upon borrower default.",,"Vehicle title collateralization allows GM Financial to secure its retail finance receivables with the vehicle itself as collateral. If a customer defaults on payment terms, GM Financial generally has the legal right to repossess the vehicle, subject to local laws. This collateralization gives GM Financial a direct remedy to recover or offset potential losses from defaults by reclaiming the asset financed with the loan.","Table of Contents

Analyze GM Financial’s monitoring of nonperforming dealer accounts versus high-risk subprime retail loans.,,"GM Financial monitors nonperforming dealer accounts and high-risk subprime retail loans using distinct approaches:

- **Nonperforming Dealer Accounts:** Dealers are assigned risk ratings (I–IV) based on proprietary models and periodic reviews. Dealers rated III or IV (nonperforming, with inadequate paying capacity) are subject to heightened monitoring and restrictions such as suspension of credit lines and forced asset liquidation. At March 31, 2024, only 1.9% of dealer balances were categorized as III, and none as IV, indicating tight control and active management of higher-risk dealers.

- **High-risk Subprime Retail Loans:** Subprime loans (FICO score <620) made up 12.6% of the retail finance receivables portfolio as of March 31, 2024. These loans are monitored based on payment activity, with GM Financial having the right to repossess the vehicle upon default. The allowance for loan losses covers 2.7% of total finance receivables, reflecting potential credit risk in this segment.

**Summary:** Dealer credit risk is addressed through continuous risk rating updates, targeted interventions, and immediate operational restrictions for problem dealers, while subprime retail loan risk is primarily managed through static credit scoring, payment monitoring, and collateral repossession upon default.","Table of Contents

GM Financial reviews the ongoing credit quality of retail finance receivables based on customer payment activity. A retail account is considered
delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date the payment was contractually due. Retail finance receivables
are collateralized by vehicle titles and, subject to local laws, GM Financial generally has the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the customer defaults
on the payment terms of the contract. The accrual of finance charge income had been suspended on delinquent retail finance receivables with contractual
amounts due of $721 million and $809 million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The following tables are consolidated summaries of the
delinquency status of the outstanding amortized cost of retail finance receivables for each vintage of the portfolio at March 31, 2024 and December 31,

Commercial Finance Receivables GM Financial's commercial finance receivables consist of dealer financing, primarily for dealer inventory purchases,
and other financing, which includes loans to commercial vehicle upfitters. For dealer financing, proprietary models are used to assign a risk rating to each
dealer. GM Financial performs periodic credit reviews of each dealership and adjusts the dealership's risk rating, if necessary. The credit risk associated with
other financing is limited due to the structure of the business relationships.

I Performing accounts with strong to acceptable financial metrics with at least satisfactory capacity to meet financial commitments.
II Performing accounts experiencing potential weakness in financial metrics and repayment prospects resulting in increased monitoring.
III Non-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and have the distinct possibility of creating a loss ifdeficiencies are not corrected.
IV Non-Performing accounts with inadequate paying capacity for current obligations and inherent weaknesses that make collection ofliquidation in full highly questionable or improbable.

Analyze how GM’s restructuring in Russia and India altered segment earnings and consolidated EPS adjustments.,,"GM’s restructuring in Russia and India led to significant one-time adjustments that impacted both segment earnings and consolidated EPS adjustments. In segment reporting, these adjustments were excluded from EBIT-adjusted because they are not reflective of core operating performance:

- **Russia Exit**: In Q2 2022, GM recorded an adjustment related to the shutdown of its Russia business, including write-offs and release of accumulated translation losses into earnings. This adjustment ($657 million in Q2 2022) reduced reported net income under U.S. GAAP, but was excluded from EBIT-adjusted and EPS-diluted-adjusted calculations to show core performance.
- **India Asset Sales**: In Q3 2023, there was an adjustment for an asset sale following GM’s strategic exit from India, resulting in a negative $111 million adjustment. Like the Russia exit, this was excluded from EBIT-adjusted and EPS-diluted-adjusted figures.

**Impact on Segment Earnings:**  
For the affected periods, these restructuring adjustments appeared in “Corporate” or were centrally recorded, rather than within GMNA or GMI segment EBIT-adjusted, ensuring that segment operational performance was not distorted by these non-recurring charges.

**Impact on EPS Adjustments:**  
Both restructuring events reduced net income as reported under GAAP but were added back when calculating EPS-diluted-adjusted. For instance, in Q3 2023, the India adjustment of $(111) million, and in Q2 2022, the Russia adjustment of $657 million, were excluded for adjusted EPS purposes, along with their related tax effects. This means adjusted EPS gives a clearer view of ongoing profitability, unaffected by these strategic exits.

**Summary:**  
GM’s restructuring in Russia and India created large, non-recurring charges that lowered GAAP net income and segment results, but these amounts were excluded from EBIT-adjusted and adjusted EPS to better reflect ongoing performance.","Table of Contents

through earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision-maker
evaluates GM Financial through earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results
when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our
strategic initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable, those vehicles attract customers to dealer showrooms and help
maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards our commitment to an all-electric future and meeting required fuel
efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis.
Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through
distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for
consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing
companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet
customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision
repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.
GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America with vehicles
developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet
the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac,
Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology, and includes AV-
related engineering and other costs. We provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.
Our automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and
certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and
cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

How do EBIT-adjusted calculations differ from U.S. GAAP net income and EPS-diluted-adjusted methods?,,"EBIT-adjusted differs from U.S. GAAP net income and EPS-diluted-adjusted by excluding certain items that are included in GAAP net income, such as interest income/expense, income tax expense/benefit, and specific adjustments (e.g., Buick dealer strategy, voluntary separation programs, restructuring costs, and certain litigation/asset sales). EBIT-adjusted focuses on operational earnings before interest and taxes, removing non-operational and one-time items to better reflect core business performance.

EPS-diluted-adjusted reconciles GAAP diluted EPS by adding the same adjustments used in EBIT-adjusted (after tax effects) to GAAP net income, then dividing by weighted-average diluted shares. This provides a per-share view that excludes specific items affecting comparability.

In summary, EBIT-adjusted is a pre-tax, pre-interest operational metric, while EPS-diluted-adjusted is a per-share metric derived from GAAP earnings, adjusted for the same non-recurring and strategic items.","Table of Contents

Note 18. Segment Reporting
We analyze the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. The chief operating decision-
maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —— (Continued)
through earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision-maker
evaluates GM Financial through earnings before income taxes (EBT)-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results
when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our
strategic initiatives. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable, those vehicles attract customers to dealer showrooms and help
maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards our commitment to an all-electric future and meeting required fuel
efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis.
Substantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through
distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for
consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing
companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet
customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision
repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.
GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America with vehicles
developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet
the demands of customers in other countries, primarily China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac,
Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development and commercialization of AV technology, and includes AV-
related engineering and other costs. We provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.
Our automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/Vauxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and
certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and
cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

"How does GM assess GMNA, GMI, Cruise, GM Fin using EBIT-adj. and EBT-adj. distinctions?",,"GM assesses the operating results and performance of its automotive segments (GMNA, GMI, and Cruise) using EBIT-adjusted (Earnings Before Interest and Income Taxes, adjusted), which excludes noncontrolling interests. For its GM Financial segment, GM uses EBT-adjusted (Earnings Before Income Taxes, adjusted), because interest income and interest expense are considered part of GM Financial's operating results. This approach allows GM to evaluate each segment using metrics most relevant to their respective business activities.","Table of Contents

The rare compliance exhibit (Exhibit 32), certified under 18 U.S.C. Section 1350 pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is a supplemental certification by the CEO and CFO stating that, to their knowledge, the report fully complies with the SEC requirements and fairly presents the company’s financial condition.

**Pro-Rata Retention:**
- Both PSU and RSU Awards are prorated based on the month in which the Full Career Status Termination occurs, according to a specified pro-ration schedule.

**Vesting Schedules and Settlement Conditions:**
- **PSUs:** The retained pro-rata portion remains subject to achievement of Performance Conditions and will vest and settle on the designated Settlement Date in the specified year, as selected by the Committee.
- **RSUs:** The retained pro-rata portion continues to vest according to the existing vesting schedule and will settle on the scheduled Settlement Dates.

**Forfeiture Rules:**
- For both PSUs and RSUs, any portion of the Award not vested (or earned, in the case of PSUs) as of the Termination of Service will be forfeited, except as otherwise specified in the Plan or Award Document.

In summary, early Full Career Status Termination leads to similar pro-rata retention and forfeiture treatment for both Awards; settlement for PSUs is tied to performance and Committee timing, while RSUs continue on their original vesting schedule.","Exhibit 10.2

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
Note 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods
presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other
factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other assets” were reclassified out of “Accounts
receivable, net and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in
India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between
consolidated entities are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-
based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating
leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ
materially from these estimates.
We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers
from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change
in estimate for Q2 2024, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of March 31, 2024 and those acquired during the three
months ended June 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $786 million and a benefit to net income of $601 million, or $0.06
per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the six months ended June 30, 2024, based on servers that were included in
“Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and
amortization expense of $1.7 billion and a benefit to net income of $1.3 billion, or $0.12 per basic share and $0.12 per diluted share.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial
position, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar
expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global
economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the
internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the
timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent
to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,
the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed
acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical
conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties,
as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in
greater detail in Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.”
For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Overview” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical
accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the
critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —
Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, “Financial
Statements — Note 1 — Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and
judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different
assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such
as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These
assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-
downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024, we would have recorded an
additional cost of sales of approximately $360 million.
In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on
forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,
principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other
conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur
during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to

"Compare effects of changing server useful lives on 2024 depreciation, net income, and EPS vs. prior estimates.",,"Changing the estimated useful lives of Amazon’s servers from five to six years, effective January 1, 2024, resulted in the following effects for 2024 compared to prior estimates:

- **Depreciation and Amortization Expense:** Reduced by $786 million in Q2 2024 and by $1.7 billion for the first six months of 2024.
- **Net Income:** Increased by $601 million in Q2 2024 and by $1.3 billion for the first six months of 2024.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Increased by $0.06 per basic and diluted share in Q2 2024, and by $0.12 per basic and diluted share for the first six months of 2024.

from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change
in estimate for Q2 2024, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of March 31, 2024 and those acquired during the three
months ended June 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $786 million and a benefit to net income of $601 million, or $0.06
per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the six months ended June 30, 2024, based on servers that were included in
“Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and
amortization expense of $1.7 billion and a benefit to net income of $1.3 billion, or $0.12 per basic share and $0.12 per diluted share.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial
position, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar
expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global
economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the
internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the
timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent
to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion,
the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed
acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical
conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties,
as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in
greater detail in Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.”
For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Overview” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical
accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the
critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —
Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, “Financial
Statements — Note 1 — Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and
judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different
assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such
as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These
assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-
downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of June 30, 2024, we would have recorded an
additional cost of sales of approximately $360 million.
In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on
forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,
principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other
conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur
during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to

"Explain how economic shifts, mgmt decisions, and GAAP-based estimates jointly affect Amazon's result risks.",,"Economic shifts, management decisions, and GAAP-based estimates jointly create significant result risks for Amazon. Economic shifts—such as changes in global demand, inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical events—can impact customer spending and operational costs. Management decisions, including investment levels, business expansion, and the mix of products and services, influence Amazon’s risk profile and financial outcomes. GAAP-based estimates, like inventory valuation, useful lives of equipment, and tax accruals, require judgment and assumptions that may differ from actual results, leading to material impacts on reported income and expenses. The combined uncertainty from these factors means Amazon’s results can differ materially from expectations, as highlighted in their forward-looking statements and risk disclosures.","Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
Note 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods
presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2024 due to seasonal and other
factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other assets” were reclassified out of “Accounts
receivable, net and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in
India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between
consolidated entities are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-
based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating
leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ
materially from these estimates.
We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2024 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers
from five to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change
in estimate for Q2 2024, based on servers that were included in “Property and equipment, net” as of March 31, 2024 and those acquired during the three
months ended June 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $786 million and a benefit to net income of $601 million, or $0.06
per basic share and $0.06 per diluted share. The effect of this change in estimate for the six months ended June 30, 2024, based on servers that were included in
“Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023 and those acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was a reduction in depreciation and
amortization expense of $1.7 billion and a benefit to net income of $1.3 billion, or $0.12 per basic share and $0.12 per diluted share.

Note 7 — INCOME TAXES
Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete
items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate
changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.
Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including
variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the
applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,
changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and
accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be
more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax
rate is greater when our pre-tax

Note 7 — INCOME TAXES
Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete
items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate
changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.
Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including
variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the
applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,
changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and
accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be
more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax

"How did unit sales growth, FX impact, and segment-wise cost eff. drive Amazon's Q2 2023–24 op. income surge?",,"Amazon’s Q2 2024 operating income surge versus Q2 2023 was driven primarily by increased unit sales and improved segment cost efficiency. Higher unit sales, including by third-party sellers, led to increased revenues across both North America and International segments. International net sales, though, were negatively affected by foreign exchange (FX), with FX reducing International net sales by $974 million in Q2 2024.

Cost efficiency efforts—such as fulfillment network optimizations, reduced payroll and related expenses, and lower depreciation/amortization due to revised server useful lives—helped offset increased fulfillment and shipping costs. AWS operating income especially benefited from higher sales, decreased payroll, and lower depreciation, with positive FX impact of $115 million in Q2 2024. Overall, these factors—unit sales growth, segment-wise cost management, and FX impacts—drove consolidated operating income up from $7.7B (Q2 2023) to $14.7B (Q2 2024).","Table of Contents
and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a
percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy,
changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of
fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our
ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features.
Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because
payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.
The increase in fulfillment costs in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due
to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced
fulfillment costs by $137 million for Q2 2024, and by $123 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes
from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.
Technology and Infrastructure
Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing
products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores,
and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and
other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide
variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and
electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.
We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve
our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and
capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and
operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are
allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to
the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization
expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for
expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced
technology and infrastructure costs by $117 million for Q2 2024, and by $154 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. See Item 7 of Part II,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales
commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party
customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales
and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we
would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.
The decrease in sales and marketing costs in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is
primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced
sales and marketing costs by $100 million for Q2 2024, and by $125 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view
these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.

music.
The increase in cost of sales in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to
increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies, including lower transportation costs.
Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $705 million for Q2 2024, and by $895 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
Shipping costs were $20.5 billion and $22.0 billion in Q2 2023 and Q2 2024, and $40.4 billion and $43.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023
and 2024. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our
customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use
more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales
volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering
low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.
Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both
our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical
stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing

International sales increased 7% in Q2 2024, and 8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales
growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were
driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our fast shipping offers. Changes in foreign
exchange rates reduced International net sales by $974 million for Q2 2024, and by $1.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
AWS sales increased 19% in Q2 2024, and 18% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth
primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.

Analyze the impact of autonomous robot deployment on Amazon’s Q2 2024 multi-region fulfillment spending.,,"The context does not specifically mention autonomous robots, but it does state that Amazon’s fulfillment costs in Q2 2024 increased primarily due to increased sales and investments in the fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Investments mentioned include initiatives for process efficiency and technology development, such as autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing and infrastructure improvements. Therefore, the deployment of autonomous robots likely contributed to increased upfront spending as part of fulfillment network investments, but also helped offset some costs through improved efficiency. This means multi-region fulfillment spending rose due to expansion and technology investments (potentially including autonomous robots), but these robots helped partially mitigate costs by driving network efficiency.","Table of Contents
and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a
percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy,
changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of
fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our
ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features.
Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because
payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.
The increase in fulfillment costs in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due
to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced
fulfillment costs by $137 million for Q2 2024, and by $123 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes
from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.
Technology and Infrastructure
Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing
products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores,
and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and
other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide
variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and
electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.
We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve
our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and
capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and
operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are
allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to
the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by a reduction in depreciation and amortization
expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers and decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for
expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced
technology and infrastructure costs by $117 million for Q2 2024, and by $154 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. See Item 7 of Part II,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview” of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a
discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales
commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party
customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales
and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we
would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.
The decrease in sales and marketing costs in Q2 2024 and for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is
primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced
sales and marketing costs by $100 million for Q2 2024, and by $125 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024.
While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view
these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.

Income Taxes
Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion, which included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits. Our income

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain
non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet
the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.
We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property
and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following
is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing
twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 (in millions):

Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 2,917 $ (21,440)

All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the
residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments
representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or
other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates

"Analyze how fluctuations in Rivian valuation, FX, and equity warrants collectively shaped net other inc./exp. for H1 2024.",,"For the six months ended June 30, 2024 (H1 2024), net other income (expense) was heavily impacted by three main factors:

1. **Rivian Valuation:** There was a significant marketable equity securities valuation loss of $(1.6) billion from the equity investment in Rivian, which was the primary driver of the $(2.7) billion net other expense. This loss far exceeded that of the prior-year period.

2. **Equity Warrants:** Equity warrant valuation losses totaled $(501) million in H1 2024, further increasing net other expense compared to H1 2023.

3. **Foreign Exchange (FX):** Foreign currency losses amounted to $(212) million, also contributing to negative net other income/expense.

Collectively, the sharp Rivian valuation loss was the largest factor, compounded by additional losses in equity warrant valuations and adverse FX movements, shaping a much larger net other expense for H1 2024 compared to H1 2023.","Table of Contents

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our
weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we
have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.
The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):

"Analyze how certifying officers integrate ICFR design, evaluation, issue disclosure, and stakeholder communication responsibilities.",,"Certifying officers, as shown in the context, integrate responsibilities for internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) in several key ways:

1. **ICFR Design:** Officers are responsible for designing, or overseeing the design of, ICFR to ensure reliable financial reporting and compliance with GAAP (see Exhibit 31.1 and 31.2, section 4(b)).

2. **Evaluation:** They evaluate the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, including ICFR, and report their conclusions in the 10-Q (section 4(c)).

3. **Issue Disclosure:** Officers must disclose any changes in ICFR during the most recent quarter that materially affect, or are likely to materially affect, financial reporting (section 4(d)). They also disclose significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, and any fraud involving management to auditors and the audit committee (section 5).

4. **Stakeholder Communication:** Through their certifications under both the Exchange Act rules and Sarbanes-Oxley Section 906 (Exhibit 32.1), officers assure stakeholders—such as investors, auditors, the audit committee, and regulators—of the integrity of financial reporting, the effectiveness of ICFR, and their compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements. 

In summary, certifying officers integrate ICFR design, evaluation, issue disclosure, and stakeholder communication by establishing controls, monitoring and evaluating their effectiveness, disclosing any material issues, and directly certifying accuracy and compliance to stakeholders.","Exhibit 31.1

However, EPS is reported for common stockholders, not preferred stockholders. Preferred stockholders generally receive dividends rather than an EPS calculation. The net income attributable to common stock ($4,395 million) is already after preferred dividends and adjustments, and the impact of equity-method investments (e.g., ""Equity in net income of affiliates"" of $1,440 million) is included in consolidated net income.

Therefore, AT&T does not report a diluted EPS for preferred stockholders; EPS is only applicable to common stockholders. The Q1 2025 diluted EPS for common stockholders, adjusted for all relevant items including equity-method investments, is $0.61.","PART I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Sum purchase of property/equipment and capitalized construction interest for AT&T’s Q1 2025 total capex.,,"AT&T’s Q1 2025 total capital expenditures (capex) is the sum of purchase of property and equipment ($4,240 million) and interest during construction - capital expenditures ($37 million), which totals **$4,277 million**.","Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent services we are required to provide to customers under bundled or discounted 
arrangements, which are satisfied as services are provided over the contract term. In determining the transaction price allocated, 
we do not include non-recurring charges and estimates for usage, nor do we consider arrangements with an original expected 
duration of less than one year, which are primarily prepaid wireless and residential internet agreements.
 
Remaining performance obligations associated with business contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect 
estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. Performance obligations associated with wireless contracts are 
estimated using a portfolio approach in which we review all relevant promotional activities, calculating the remaining 
performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average device price. As of March 31, 
2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $41,685, of which we 
expect to recognize approximately 83% by the end of 2026, with the balance recognized thereafter.
 
NOTE 6. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
Many of our employees are covered by one of our noncontributory pension plans. We also provide certain medical, dental, life 
insurance and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement 
benefit costs. Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to 
employees upon their retirement. We do not have significant funding requirements in 2025.
 
We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our consolidated results as a component of 
“Other income (expense) – net” at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. 
The following table details qualified pension and postretirement benefit costs included in the accompanying consolidated 
statements of income. The service cost component of net periodic pension (credit) cost is recorded in operating expenses in the 
consolidated statements of income while the remaining components are recorded in “Other income (expense) – net.”

"Identify links between Q1 2025 total revenue, business units, and each major service/equipment category.",,"For Q1 2025, AT&T’s total revenue was $30,626 million. This revenue is divided among major business units: Mobility, Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline, Latin America, and Corporate & Other. 

Each business unit contributes to the following service and equipment categories:

- **Service Categories:** Wireless, Fiber and Advanced Connectivity, Non-fiber Consumer Broadband, Legacy and Other Transitional, and Other.
- **Equipment Category:** Revenue from sales of equipment (primarily wireless devices).

Key links:
- Mobility contributed the largest share, with $16,651 million from wireless services and $4,919 million from equipment.
- Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline revenue is mainly from fiber/advanced connectivity, legacy services, non-fiber broadband, and some equipment.
- Latin America and Corporate & Other contributed smaller proportions across wireless and equipment.

In summary, Q1 2025 total revenue links directly to the sum of business unit contributions across both service and equipment sales.","Remaining Performance Obligations

"How are recurring portfolio obligations, deferred contract costs, and prepaid agreements <1 yr treated in AT&T statements?",,"AT&T treats recurring portfolio obligations by estimating remaining performance obligations for wireless contracts using a portfolio approach—averaging service components and device prices across all relevant contracts. Deferred contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, such as commissions, are capitalized and amortized over three to five years (the contract period or expected customer relationship life). Prepaid agreements and contracts with an original expected duration of less than one year (mainly prepaid wireless and residential internet) are excluded from the calculation of remaining performance obligations.","Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent services we are required to provide to customers under bundled or discounted 
arrangements, which are satisfied as services are provided over the contract term. In determining the transaction price allocated, 
we do not include non-recurring charges and estimates for usage, nor do we consider arrangements with an original expected 
duration of less than one year, which are primarily prepaid wireless and residential internet agreements.
 
Remaining performance obligations associated with business contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect 
estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. Performance obligations associated with wireless contracts are 
estimated using a portfolio approach in which we review all relevant promotional activities, calculating the remaining 
performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average device price. As of March 31, 
2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $41,685, of which we 
expect to recognize approximately 83% by the end of 2026, with the balance recognized thereafter.
 
NOTE 6. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
 
Many of our employees are covered by one of our noncontributory pension plans. We also provide certain medical, dental, life 
insurance and death benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement 
benefit costs. Our objective in funding these plans, in combination with the standards of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), is to accumulate assets sufficient to provide benefits described in the plans to 
employees upon their retirement. We do not have significant funding requirements in 2025.
 
We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets in our consolidated results as a component of 
“Other income (expense) – net” at our annual measurement date of December 31, unless earlier remeasurements are required. 
The following table details qualified pension and postretirement benefit costs included in the accompanying consolidated 
statements of income. The service cost component of net periodic pension (credit) cost is recorded in operating expenses in the 
consolidated statements of income while the remaining components are recorded in “Other income (expense) – net.”

"Explain how cross-currency/interest rate swaps structure simultaneously mitigates FX, interest rate exposures, and impacts OCI/income.",,"Cross-currency and interest rate swaps are structured to hedge both foreign currency (FX) risk and interest rate risk on foreign-denominated debt. The swap agreements involve exchanging principal and interest payments in a foreign currency for equivalent payments in U.S. dollars at specified rates, often determined by market spot rates at issuance. Additionally, these swaps convert fixed or floating foreign interest rates to fixed U.S. dollar rates.

The gains or losses from these swaps affect financial statements as follows:
- For fair value hedges: Changes in fair value of the derivatives are generally offset against the change in fair value of the hedged debt in earnings, except for certain excluded components which are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) and amortized into earnings over the hedge’s life.
- For cash flow hedges: Unrealized gains/losses on derivatives are recorded in OCI and later reclassified to income in the period when the hedged transaction impacts earnings (e.g., interest expense).

Thus, this structure mitigates both FX and interest rate risk while also managing the timing and recognition of hedge-related gains or losses across OCI and net income.","basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change 
in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
 
Unrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of 
income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to 
exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such 
excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the 
hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and 
unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of 
derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or 
liabilities through earnings. In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value 
hedges.
 
Cash Flow Hedging We designate some of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to variability in 
expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk generated from our foreign-
denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts 
to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate 
upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. 
dollar denominated interest rate.
Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets and unrealized losses are 
recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported 
as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the 
hedged transaction affects earnings.
Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments 
attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. 
We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized 
into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to 
“Interest expense” due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.
Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing 
collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At March 31, 2025, we had posted collateral of 
$196 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T’s credit rating had been 
downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody’s before the final collateral 
exchange in March, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $50. If AT&T’s credit rating had been 
downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P and two levels by Moody’s, we would have been required 
to post additional collateral of $3,657. At December 31, 2024, we had posted collateral of $188 (a deposit asset) and held 
collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a 
receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments.

Investment Securities
Our investment securities include both equity and debt securities that are measured at fair value, as well as equity securities 
without readily determinable fair values. A substantial portion of the fair values of our investment securities is estimated based 
on quoted market prices. Investments in equity securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued at cost, less 
any impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. 
Investments in debt securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of 
securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.

three years: $100; three to five years: $100; five or more years: $392.
 
Our cash equivalents (money market securities) and short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) are recorded at 
amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments are recorded in “Prepaid 
and other current assets” and our investment securities are recorded in “Other Assets” on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange 
risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest 
rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We 
record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield 
curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are 
presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.
 
Fair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The 
purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps 
involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the 
underlying principal amount.
 
We also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these 
contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-
currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency

NOTE 8. SALES OF RECEIVABLES
 
We have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts 
receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising 
from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and beneficial interests, such as deferred purchase price, when 
applicable, and (2) revolving trade receivables, which are sold for cash. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, 
we continue to service the transferred receivables on behalf of the financial institutions.
The following table sets forth a summary of cash proceeds received, net of remittances paid, from sales of receivables:

2 Net of facility fees.
The sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to “Total Assets” reported 
on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our 
consolidated statements of cash flows. In the event cash is received on the beneficial interests, those receipts are classified as 
cash flows from investing activities, when applicable.

How do unrealized derivative gains/losses differ between fair value vs. cash flow hedges in affecting OCI and earnings?,,"Unrealized derivative gains and losses are treated differently for fair value and cash flow hedges:

- **Fair Value Hedges:** Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets (gains) or liabilities (losses), and—except for excluded components—the changes are offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings, not OCI. For excluded components, unrealized gains/losses are recorded in accumulated OCI and recognized in earnings over the hedge’s life.

- **Cash Flow Hedges:** Unrealized gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value reported in accumulated OCI. These amounts are reclassified to earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects income.

**In summary:** For fair value hedges, gains/losses (except excluded components) impact earnings directly; for cash flow hedges, gains/losses flow through OCI and are reclassified into earnings when the hedged item impacts income.","basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange 
risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest 
rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We 
record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield

presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.
 
Fair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The 
purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps 
involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the 
underlying principal amount.
 
We also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these 
contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-
currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency

NOTE 8. SALES OF RECEIVABLES
 
We have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts 
receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising 
from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and beneficial interests, such as deferred purchase price, when 
applicable, and (2) revolving trade receivables, which are sold for cash. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, 
we continue to service the transferred receivables on behalf of the financial institutions.
The following table sets forth a summary of cash proceeds received, net of remittances paid, from sales of receivables:

2 Net of facility fees.
The sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to “Total Assets” reported 
on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our 
consolidated statements of cash flows. In the event cash is received on the beneficial interests, those receipts are classified as 
cash flows from investing activities, when applicable.

Compare the 2025 vs. 2024 operating cash flows from equipment and revolving receivable sales’ net cash receipts.,,"For the three months ended March 31, 2025, net cash received from equipment installment receivables was $859 million and from revolving receivables was $133 million, totaling $992 million in operating cash flows. For the same period in 2024, net cash received was $121 million from equipment installment receivables and $276 million from revolving receivables, totaling $397 million. Thus, 2025 saw a significant increase in total net cash received from these receivable sales compared to 2024 ($992 million vs. $397 million).","basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change 
in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
 
Unrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of 
income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to 
exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such 
excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the 
hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and 
unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of 
derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or 
liabilities through earnings. In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value 
hedges.
 
Cash Flow Hedging We designate some of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to variability in 
expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk generated from our foreign-
denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts 
to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate 
upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. 
dollar denominated interest rate.
Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets and unrealized losses are 
recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported 
as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the 
hedged transaction affects earnings.
Periodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments 
attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. 
We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized 
into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to 
“Interest expense” due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.
Collateral and Credit-Risk Contingency We have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing 
collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At March 31, 2025, we had posted collateral of 
$196 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T’s credit rating had been 
downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody’s before the final collateral 
exchange in March, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $50. If AT&T’s credit rating had been 
downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P and two levels by Moody’s, we would have been required 
to post additional collateral of $3,657. At December 31, 2024, we had posted collateral of $188 (a deposit asset) and held 
collateral of $0 (a receipt liability). We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a 
receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments.

Compare how Level 2 vs. Level 3 fair value measurements affect AT&T's derivative risk management strategies.,,"Level 2 fair value measurements, which AT&T uses for all its derivatives (including interest rate and cross-currency swaps), rely on observable market data like yield curves and foreign exchange rates. This provides more reliable, market-based valuations for derivative instruments and supports more precise and transparent risk management of interest rate and currency exposures.

In contrast, Level 3 fair value measurements apply to items with significant unobservable inputs—such as beneficial interests and guarantee obligations in the equipment installment receivables program. These require management estimates based on expected cash flows and device trade-in values, introducing more subjectivity and potential volatility. While critical for receivables management, Level 3 valuations are less transparent and may increase measurement risk.

In summary, AT&T’s derivative risk management is primarily supported by Level 2 measurements, enabling robust, market-based hedging, while Level 3 measurements mainly affect receivables programs and introduce greater estimation risk but are not directly used for derivative hedges.","Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance:

Equipment Installment Receivables Program
We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time and, in 
many cases, once certain conditions are met, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have 
the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled.
 
We maintain a program under which we transfer a portion of these receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary in 
exchange for cash and beneficial interests. In the event a customer trades in a device prior to the end of the installment contract 
period, we agree to make a payment to the financial institutions equal to any outstanding remaining installment receivable 
balance. Accordingly, we record a guarantee obligation for this estimated amount at the time the receivables are transferred.
 
The following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold under this program:

Beneficial interests, when applicable, and guarantee obligations are initially recorded at estimated fair value and subsequently 
adjusted for changes in present value of expected cash flows. The estimation of their fair values is based on remaining 
installment payments expected to be collected and the expected timing and value of device trade-ins. The estimated value of the 
device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties and contemplates changes in value after the launch 
of a device model. The fair value measurements used for the beneficial interests and the guarantee obligation are considered 
Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 7).

We have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts 
receivable. The most significant of these programs are discussed in detail below and generally consist of (1) receivables arising 
from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and beneficial interests, such as deferred purchase price, when 
applicable, and (2) revolving trade receivables, which are sold for cash. Under the terms of our agreements for these programs, 
we continue to service the transferred receivables on behalf of the financial institutions.

Equipment Installment Receivables Program
We offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time and, in 
many cases, once certain conditions are met, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have 
the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled.
 
We maintain a program under which we transfer a portion of these receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary in 
exchange for cash and beneficial interests. In the event a customer trades in a device prior to the end of the installment contract 
period, we agree to make a payment to the financial institutions equal to any outstanding remaining installment receivable 
balance. Accordingly, we record a guarantee obligation for this estimated amount at the time the receivables are transferred.

Beneficial interests, when applicable, and guarantee obligations are initially recorded at estimated fair value and subsequently 
adjusted for changes in present value of expected cash flows. The estimation of their fair values is based on remaining 
installment payments expected to be collected and the expected timing and value of device trade-ins. The estimated value of the 
device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties and contemplates changes in value after the launch 
of a device model. The fair value measurements used for the beneficial interests and the guarantee obligation are considered 
Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 7).

Investment Securities
Our investment securities include both equity and debt securities that are measured at fair value, as well as equity securities 
without readily determinable fair values. A substantial portion of the fair values of our investment securities is estimated based 
on quoted market prices. Investments in equity securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued at cost, less 
any impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. 
Investments in debt securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of 
securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.

three years: $100; three to five years: $100; five or more years: $392.
 
Our cash equivalents (money market securities) and short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) are recorded at 
amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments are recorded in “Prepaid 
and other current assets” and our investment securities are recorded in “Other Assets” on the consolidated balance sheets.
 
Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange 
risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest 
rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We 
record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield 
curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are 
presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.
 
Fair Value Hedging Periodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The 
purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps 
involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the 
underlying principal amount.
 
We also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these 
contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-
currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency

"How do AT&T's FV hierarchy levels, pricing models, and estimation methods differ for investment securities vs. derivatives?",,"AT&T's investment securities and derivatives differ in fair value hierarchy levels, pricing models, and estimation methods:

- **Investment Securities:**  
  - **Hierarchy Levels:** Most investment securities are measured at Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets) or Level 2 (observable inputs like pricing models or similar securities). Some beneficial interests and guarantee obligations related to receivables programs are Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs).
  - **Pricing Models:** Equity securities traded on exchanges use market prices. Non-traded equity securities are valued at cost, adjusted for observable transactions or impairment. Debt securities not traded actively are valued using pricing models, similar quoted securities, or discounted cash flows.
  - **Estimation Methods:** Rely on market prices when available, or use observable orderly transactions/inputs; Level 3 items are estimated based on expected cash flows and device trade-in values.

- **Derivatives:**  
  - **Hierarchy Levels:** All derivatives are classified as Level 2, using observable market data.
  - **Pricing Models:** Fair values are estimated from market data, including yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and pricing models.
  - **Estimation Methods:** Derivative values are derived solely from observable inputs, without significant unobservable estimates.

**Summary:** Investment securities use Level 1–3 inputs and various pricing methods depending on liquidity and market availability, while derivatives exclusively use Level 2, with fair values determined from observable market data.","Following are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance:

NOTE 4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer 
segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two 
reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.
 
Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer and President. Our CODM uses operating income 
to evaluate performance and allocate resources, including capital allocations, when managing the business. Our CODM 
manages operations through the review of actual and forecasted “Operations and Support Expenses” information at a segment 
and business unit level, with Communications and Latin America segments primarily evaluated on a direct cost basis and 
comprised of equipment, compensation, network and technology, sales, advertising and other costs. 
Additionally, business unit expenses within the Communications segment include direct and shared costs. Direct costs are 
incurred in support of products and services offered by the business units, such as equipment costs (predominantly wireless 
devices), network access, rents, leases, sales support, customer provisioning and commission expenses. Shared costs amongst 
the business units generally include information technology, network engineering and construction costs, advertising and other 
general and administrative expenses.

"Analyze challenges of implementing multi-segment, globally integrated telecom solutions leveraging AT&T's shared infrastructure.",,"Implementing multi-segment, globally integrated telecom solutions leveraging AT&T’s shared infrastructure presents several challenges:

1. **Complex Cost Allocation**: AT&T’s Communications segment includes direct and shared costs (such as IT, network engineering, and general admin expenses) spread across different business units and regions. Accurately allocating these costs can be complex and may affect profitability assessments.

2. **Operational Coordination**: Integrating product offerings that ""cut across product lines and utilize shared assets"" requires close coordination between mobility, business wireline, and consumer wireline units, as well as between the U.S. and global operations. Aligning technology, processes, and customer support across units is challenging.

3. **Geographic and Regulatory Differences**: The Latin America segment operates in Mexico, while Communications serves the U.S. and global business clients. Navigating different regulatory environments, market demands, and currency risks complicates unified solution deployment.

4. **Service Consistency and Customization**: Delivering seamless, high-quality services across business segments and regions while accommodating local requirements and legacy services (e.g., legacy telephony) requires balancing standardization with customization.

5. **Integration and Transition Costs**: Shared infrastructure may involve integration or restructuring costs, and efficiency gains can be offset by merger-related significant items and retained costs (e.g., from divested video operations).

In summary, operational complexity, cost allocation, regulatory compliance, and consistent service delivery are key challenges when leveraging AT&T’s shared infrastructure for globally integrated, multi-segment telecom solutions.","OVERVIEW

NOTE 4. SEGMENT INFORMATION
 
Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer 
segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two 
reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.
 
Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer and President. Our CODM uses operating income 
to evaluate performance and allocate resources, including capital allocations, when managing the business. Our CODM 
manages operations through the review of actual and forecasted “Operations and Support Expenses” information at a segment 
and business unit level, with Communications and Latin America segments primarily evaluated on a direct cost basis and 
comprised of equipment, compensation, network and technology, sales, advertising and other costs. 
Additionally, business unit expenses within the Communications segment include direct and shared costs. Direct costs are 
incurred in support of products and services offered by the business units, such as equipment costs (predominantly wireless 
devices), network access, rents, leases, sales support, customer provisioning and commission expenses. Shared costs amongst 
the business units generally include information technology, network engineering and construction costs, advertising and other 
general and administrative expenses.

In what ways do AT&T’s Mexico wireless services differ from U.S. Mobility and Wireline offerings?,,"AT&T’s Mexico wireless services, part of its Latin America segment, focus solely on providing wireless services and equipment in Mexico. In contrast, its U.S. Communications segment offers a broader range of services, including:

- Mobility: Nationwide wireless service and equipment in the U.S.
- Business Wireline: Advanced ethernet-based fiber services, fixed wireless, IP Voice, managed professional services, and legacy voice/data for businesses globally.
- Consumer Wireline: Broadband (fiber, multi-gig, AIA over 5G), internet, and legacy telephony for U.S. residential customers.

Thus, AT&T’s U.S. operations offer both wireless and a wide range of wireline (broadband, fiber, voice) services, while in Mexico, the focus is only on wireless.","OVERVIEW
AT&T Inc. is referred to as “we,” “AT&T” or the “Company” throughout this document. AT&T products and services are 
provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc., and the names of 
the particular subsidiaries and affiliates providing the services generally have been omitted. AT&T is a holding company whose 
subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. You should read this

How did shifts in current assets/liabilities and equity affect UHG’s Q1-2024 balance sheet?,,"In Q1-2024, UnitedHealth Group's (UHG) current assets rose by $10.5 billion (from $78.4B to $88.9B), mainly due to higher cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. Current liabilities also increased by $5.4 billion (from $99.1B to $104.4B), driven by rises in medical costs payable and short-term borrowings. Total equity decreased by $2.1 billion (from $94.4B to $92.4B), primarily reflecting lower retained earnings, likely due to net losses, share repurchases, and dividend payments. Overall, asset and liability increases were partially offset by a reduction in equity, impacting the Q1-2024 balance sheet.","PART I

Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1. Basis of Presentation 
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) 
is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work 
better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are 
working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and 
experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.
The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end 
condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures 
required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the 
Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual 
audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read 
together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the 
SEC (2023 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments 
necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. 
Use of Estimates
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and 
judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and 
goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve 
matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is 
included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.
Revenues - Products and Services
As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accounts receivable related to products and services were $10.3 billion and 
$8.6 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining 
performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, 
contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance 
obligations, was $14.3 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.

1. Basis of Presentation 
UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) 
is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work 
better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are 
working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and 
experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.
The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end 
condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures 
required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the 
Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual 
audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read 
together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and 
Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the 
SEC (2023 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments 
necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly. 
Use of Estimates
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and 
judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and 
goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve 
matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is 
included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.
Revenues - Products and Services
As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accounts receivable related to products and services were $10.3 billion and 
$8.6 billion, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining 
performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, 
contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance 
obligations, was $14.3 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.

The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2024 were generated from approximately 32,000 
positions out of a total of 39,000 positions. The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its 
debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate 
increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s 
assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt 
securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company 
evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit 
deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2024, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale 
debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for 
credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.

"How did rising interest rates, without significant credit deterioration, cause $2.9B unrealized AFS losses as of 3/31/24?",,"Rising interest rates caused the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities to fall below their amortized cost, leading to $2.9 billion in unrealized losses as of March 31, 2024. These losses were not due to credit deterioration—since the company noted no significant decline in issuer credit quality or expected cash flows—but were primarily driven by market price declines resulting from higher interest rates. The company views these losses as temporary, as it does not intend to sell these securities and expects to collect the full principal and interest.","The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities as of March 31, 2024, by contractual maturity, were as follows:

The Company’s unrealized losses from debt securities as of March 31, 2024 were generated from approximately 32,000 
positions out of a total of 39,000 positions. The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its 
debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate 
increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s 
assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt 
securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company 
evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit 
deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2024, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale 
debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for 
credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.

These acquisitions are subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions.

Regarding legal matters, the Company is involved in a lawsuit originally filed by a whistleblower in 2011 and later joined by the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the False Claims Act, alleging improper risk adjustment submissions. The case’s outcome cannot be reasonably estimated due to its procedural status.

The Company is also subject to ongoing CMS risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits, which examine the coding practices and supporting documentation of health care providers. These audits may lead to retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans. The scope and results of these audits remain uncertain at this time.","For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the 2023 10-

6. Commitments and Contingencies
Pending Acquisitions
As of March 31, 2024, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to 
regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these acquisitions, 
excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $4 billion.
Legal Matters
The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits 
brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s 
businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical 
malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits 
coverage and other business practices.  
The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of 
costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where 
the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present 
novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the 
early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to 
estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be 
incurred.
Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews
The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These 
include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the 
Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade 
Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. 
Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign 
governments. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental 
entities. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether 
its business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Certain of the Company’s 
businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and 
other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk 
adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by 
health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.
On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the 
Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 
2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 
2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss 
the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the 
court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without 
prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.
11|RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
There are no recently issued accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, 
which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and 
estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent 
liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. 
On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, 
however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations.
Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical 
accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included 
in Part II, Item 7 in our 2023 10-K. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of Notes to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our 2023 10-

"How could DOJ lawsuits, CMS RADV audits, or regulatory shifts individually impact revenue projections?",,"DOJ lawsuits, CMS RADV audits, or regulatory shifts could individually impact revenue projections by creating financial uncertainty and potential liabilities. DOJ lawsuits, like the one related to improper risk adjustment submissions, may lead to fines, penalties, or required changes in business practices, which can increase costs or reduce revenue. CMS RADV audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments received for Medicare plans, directly affecting revenue. Regulatory shifts—such as changes in health care laws, enforcement, or risk adjustment data policies—can alter revenue streams and increase compliance costs, thus impacting overall financial projections.","For more information on the Company’s short-term borrowings, debt covenants and long-term debt, see Note 8 of Notes to the

6. Commitments and Contingencies
Pending Acquisitions
As of March 31, 2024, the Company has entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to 
regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated consideration required for these acquisitions, 
excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $4 billion.
Legal Matters
The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits 
brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers and regulators, relating to the Company’s 
businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical 
malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits 
coverage and other business practices.  
The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of 
costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where 
the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present 
novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the 
early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to 
estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be 
incurred.
Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews
The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These 
include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the 
Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade 
Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. 
Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign 
governments. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental 
entities. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether 
its business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Certain of the Company’s 
businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and 
other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk 
adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by 
health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.
On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the 
Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 
2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 
2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss 
the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the 
court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without 
prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to make judgments, assumptions and estimates, 
which we believe are reasonable and prudent based on the available facts and circumstances. These judgments, assumptions and 
estimates affect certain of our revenues and expenses and their related balance sheet accounts and disclosure of our contingent 
liabilities. We base our assumptions and estimates primarily on historical experience and consider known and projected trends. 
On an ongoing basis, we re-evaluate our selection of assumptions and the method of calculating our estimates. Actual results, 
however, may materially differ from our calculated estimates, and this difference would be reported in our current operations.
Our critical accounting estimates include medical costs payable and goodwill. For a detailed description of our critical 
accounting estimates, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in 
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time 
periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the 
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our 
disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of 
March 31, 2024.

Based on this process, the CEO and CFO concluded the controls were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of March 31, 2024.","ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt 
across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of 
interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in 
comprehensive income.
The following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1%

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934 (Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in 
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time 
periods specified in SEC rules and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
In connection with the filing of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the 
participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our 
disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of 
March 31, 2024.
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have

"Assess implications of rapid, parallel shifts in both interest rate volatility and fair value reporting standards.",,"Rapid, parallel shifts in interest rate volatility would significantly impact both investment income and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, as illustrated in the provided sensitivity table. For example, a 2% increase in rates decreases the fair value of financial assets by $3,616 million and financial liabilities by $8,439 million, while similarly affecting investment income and interest expense. Changes in fair value reporting standards—if they require more frequent or transparent recognition of unrealized gains and losses—could further amplify the volatility reflected in comprehensive income and reported results. This could increase reported earnings variability and affect stakeholders’ perception of financial stability, requiring enhanced risk management and disclosure controls, which the company maintains and has deemed effective as of March 31, 2024.","ITEM 3.

"How did net income, dividends, and buybacks influence AAPL’s ending equity from Q4 ’23 to Q1 ’24?",,"From Q4 ‘23 to Q1 ‘24, Apple’s ending shareholders’ equity increased significantly, mainly due to net income. Specifically:

- **Net income** added $33.9 billion to equity.
- **Dividends** and dividend equivalents declared reduced equity by $3.8 billion.
- **Common stock repurchases (buybacks)** lowered equity by $20.7 billion.

Overall, strong net income outweighed the reductions from dividends and buybacks, increasing shareholders’ equity from $62.1 billion at the end of Q4 ’23 to $74.1 billion at the end of Q1 ’24.","Apple Inc.

Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
(collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial 
statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. 
The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the 
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s

the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K 
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is 
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which 
occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. 
Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended

Calculate the YoY % change in Apple’s Q1 deferred revenue and key contributors to that variation.,,"Apple’s deferred revenue as of December 30, 2023 was $12.5 billion, compared to $12.1 billion as of September 30, 2023, reflecting a year-over-year increase of $0.4 billion. The year-over-year (YoY) percentage change is approximately 3.3% [($12.5B – $12.1B) / $12.1B * 100%]. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily driven by growth in Services, particularly higher net sales from advertising, video, and cloud services, as well as continued growth in revenue from the iPhone Pro models.","Item 2.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in 
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of 
sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect 
distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an 
older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and 
distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is 
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which 
occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.
Quarterly Highlights
The Company’s first quarter of 2024 included 13 weeks, compared to 14 weeks during the first quarter of 2023.
The Company’s total net sales increased 2% or $2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 
2023, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of iPad and Wearables, 
Home and Accessories.
During the first quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Pro® 14-in., MacBook Pro 16-in. and iMac®.
The Company repurchased $20.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during 
the first quarter of 2024.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly 
impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in 
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of 
sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect 
distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an 
older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and 
distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is 
included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which 
occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.
Quarterly Highlights
The Company’s first quarter of 2024 included 13 weeks, compared to 14 weeks during the first quarter of 2023.
The Company’s total net sales increased 2% or $2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter in 
2023, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of iPad and Wearables, 
Home and Accessories.
During the first quarter of 2024, the Company announced an updated MacBook Pro® 14-in., MacBook Pro 16-in. and iMac®.
The Company repurchased $20.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during 
the first quarter of 2024.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly 
impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical 
accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2024. For a discussion of the 
Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and 
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2023 Form 10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal 
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act  were effective as of December  30, 2023 to provide reasonable 
assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is 
(i)  recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and 
(ii)  accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal 
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2024, which were 
identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the 
Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over 
financial reporting.

Analyze the outcomes and business impacts of Apple’s disputes with Epic (antitrust) and Masimo (patent).,,"Apple’s dispute with Epic Games resulted in a largely favorable outcome for Apple. Courts rejected all of Epic’s antitrust claims, with the U.S. Supreme Court’s January 16, 2024 decision confirming prior dismissals. However, Apple was required to allow developers to include external links for alternative purchasing on U.S. App Store apps, a change it has now implemented, though Epic has indicated it may challenge Apple’s compliance. The main business impact is potential reduced in-app purchasing revenue, as users may be directed to external payment options, but core platform control remains with Apple.

In the Masimo patent case, the U.S. ITC issued a limited exclusion order banning U.S. sales and imports of certain Apple Watch models with blood oxygen features. Apple responded by redesigning the affected watches, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruled the redesign is outside the exclusion order’s scope, allowing continued sales and imports. The business impact was short-term disruption and compliance costs but minimal ongoing operational restriction, as Apple adapted to maintain market access.

In summary, while both disputes required Apple to make operational changes, neither resulted in material long-term harm to its business model or financial condition, though external regulatory and legal risks remain.","PART II  —  OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) 
against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the 
Company’s operation of its App Store®. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to 
nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store 
Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting 
developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app 
purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS ® App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and 
Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied 
both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to 
the U.S. Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”). On January 16, 2024, the Supreme Court denied both the Company’s and Epic’s 
petitions and the stay terminated. The Supreme Court’s denial of Epic’s petition confirms the District Court’s ruling in favor of the 
Company with respect to all of the antitrust claims. Following termination of the stay, the Company implemented a plan to comply 
with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the District Court. On January 31, 2024, Epic filed a notice with the 
District Court indicating its intent to dispute the Company’s compliance plan.
Masimo
Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade 
Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen 
feature in Apple Watch® Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to 
the U.S. of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a 
limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the U.S. of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen 
sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra™  2. The Company subsequently proposed a 
redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (the “CBP”) and appealed 
the Order. On January 12, 2024, the CBP found that the Company’s proposed redesign of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple 
Watch Ultra 2 falls outside the scope of the Order, permitting the Company to import and sell the models in the U.S.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the 
ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in 
the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is 
inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above 
management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially 
adversely affected.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of 
factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the 
heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, 
results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, 
there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K.
The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory 
scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.
From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, 
competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes 
in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers 
within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.
Apple Inc. | Q1 2024 Form 10-Q | 19|In January 2024, the Company announced changes to iOS, the App Store and Safari ® in the European Union to comply with the 
Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS apps, alternative methods of 
distribution for iOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools 
and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for developers. Although the Company’s compliance plan is intended to address 
the DMA’s obligations, it is still subject to potential challenge by the European Commission or private litigants. In addition, other 
jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company 
in the European Union are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks the DMA poses to European Union users, many 
risks will remain.
The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in 
legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact 
on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of 
investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse 
findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes 
to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and 
financial condition.
Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become 
subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the 
Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, 
results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other 
companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are 
currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.
There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by 
the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s 
business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact 
the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the 
Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market 
acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.

"How do Apple’s DMA-driven EU changes to iOS, App Store, and Safari compare to its U.S. App Store modifications?",,"Apple’s changes in the European Union (EU) due to the Digital Markets Act (DMA) are broader than its U.S. App Store modifications. In the EU, Apple announced changes to iOS, the App Store, and Safari, including new business terms and alternative fee structures, alternative methods of app distribution, alternative payment processing, and more developer tools and APIs. In contrast, in the U.S., Apple’s changes have focused mainly on allowing developers to communicate with consumers about alternative purchasing mechanisms within apps on the iOS and iPadOS App Store (due to litigation like the Epic Games case). Thus, while U.S. changes relate primarily to developer communications about payments, EU changes encompass multiple facets of app distribution and operation.","PART II  —  OTHER INFORMATION

Analyze the effect of VIE-related observable transactions on Level 3 non-marketable equity sec. valuation.,,"Observable transactions involving VIE-related non-marketable equity securities can affect their fair value classification. If an observable transaction for an identical or similar investment in a VIE occurs, the affected securities may be measured at fair value and classified as Level 2 or Level 3, depending on the availability and nature of observable inputs. Specifically, if an observable transaction is used for fair value adjustment, the security is often moved to Level 2. However, if the fair value is determined due to impairment and relies heavily on unobservable inputs (such as volatility, expected exit timing, and deal rights/obligations), the security remains in Level 3. Thus, observable transactions for VIE-related securities generally reduce reliance on unobservable inputs and may trigger a reclassification from Level 3 to Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.","As of March 31, 2025

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable 
market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable 
transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities 
that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment 
are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, 
and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the 
transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the 
rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.
As of March 31, 2025 , the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $48.6 billion, of which 
$25.0 billion  were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025  and were primarily 
classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

13|Level 1 and Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets 
or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.
Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we 
use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market 
observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value 
option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to 
align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

Investments Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable 
market values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable 
transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Non-marketable equity securities 
that have been remeasured during the period based on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or 
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment 
are classified within Level 3. Our valuation methods include option pricing models, market comparable approach, 
and common stock equivalent method, which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the 
transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, expected time to exit, risk free rate, and the 
rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. These inputs vary significantly based on investment type.
As of March 31, 2025 , the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $48.6 billion, of which 
$25.0 billion  were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended March 31, 2025  and were primarily 
classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.

or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.
Debt securities are measured at fair value and classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, because we 
use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market 
observable inputs to determine fair value. For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value 
option for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. The fair value option was elected for these securities to 
align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts.

of $2.8 billion  and  $9.7 billion  of upward adjustments and $814 million  and $399 million  of  downward adjustments 
(including impairments) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively.
In the table above, rea lized net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period refl ects the difference 
between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the 
purchase date, if later.
Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following 
table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity 
security sold during the period. While these net gains (losses) may have been reflected in periods prior to the period 
of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains (losses) on 
the securities sold during the period. Cumulative net gains (losses) are calculated as the difference between the 
sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period.

"Analyze how EC fines, including FX and interest effects, influenced quarterly accrued liabilities and AOCI changes, 2024–2025.",,"From December 31, 2024 to March 31, 2025, the European Commission (EC) fines (including FX and interest effects) increased accrued expenses and other current liabilities from $6,322 million to $6,534 million, contributing to the overall rise in total accrued expenses and other current liabilities from $51,228 million to $58,300 million.

Regarding AOCI, foreign currency translation adjustments improved from $(5,080) million to $(4,417) million over the same period, reflecting a $663 million positive effect, which could be partially attributed to FX changes impacting both liabilities and equity. However, changes in EC fines primarily affected current liabilities, with their FX and interest impacts more directly influencing reported liability balances than AOCI components.","Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities

For EMEA, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the euro, resulting in a reported revenue growth of 9% versus a constant currency growth of 12%—a 3 percentage point negative FX effect. Similarly, for Other Americas, the U.S. dollar strengthened mainly against the Brazilian real, leading to a reported revenue growth of 12%, while constant currency growth was 23%, reflecting an 11 percentage point negative FX effect.

Total cost of revenues $ 33,712 $ 36,361 
Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues  42 %  40 %
Cost of revenues increased $2.6 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2025  due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.8 billion  and $802 million , 
respectively. 
The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 
was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to 
TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.0% to 20.6% from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google 
Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three months 
ended March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to increases related to mobile 
searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The 
TAC rate on Google Network revenues  decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.
The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2025  was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube,  
depreciation expense, and other technical infrastructure operations costs.

Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased $4.5 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the 
three months ended March 31, 2025 . The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in 
search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; 
and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased $837 million  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 . The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our 
brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.
Google Network
Google Network revenues decreased $157 million from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 , primarily due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates and a 
decrease in Google Ad Manager and AdMob revenues. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in 
AdSense revenues.
Monetization Metrics
The following table presents changes in monetization metrics for Google Search & other revenues (paid clicks 
and cost-per-click) and Google Network revenues (impressions and cost-per-impression), expressed as a 
percentage, from three months ended March 31, 2024 to three months ended March 31, 2025:
Google Search & other
Paid clicks change  2 %
Cost-per-click change  7 %
Google Network
Impressions change  (5) %
Cost-per-impression change  4 %
Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in 
advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search 
queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.
Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including 
changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, 
property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenu es increased $1.6 billion  from the three months ended 
March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025 . The growth was primarily driven by an increase in 
subscription revenues. The increase in subscript ion revenues was primarily due to growth in the number of paid 
subscribers across both YouTube services and Google One.  
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues increased $2.7 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure

"How did USD strength vs. euro, yen, AUD, KRW, and real affect Q1 2025 EMEA/APAC/Other Americas revenues?",,"In Q1 2025, revenues for EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were negatively impacted by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the euro, Japanese yen, Australian dollar (AUD), South Korean won (KRW), and Brazilian real, respectively. For EMEA, the stronger USD versus the euro led to lower reported revenue growth. Similarly, APAC’s revenue growth was reduced due to USD strength versus the yen, AUD, and KRW. In Other Americas, USD appreciation versus the real also unfavorably affected revenue growth. Overall, these currency effects reduced reported year-over-year growth in these regions compared to constant currency results.","The following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues

Cost of revenues increased $2.6 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2025  due to an increase in other cost of revenues and TAC of $1.8 billion  and $802 million , 
respectively. 
The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2024 to the three months ended March 31, 2025 
was largely due to an increase in TAC paid to distribution partners, primarily driven by growth in revenues subject to 
TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 21.0% to 20.6% from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties to Google 
Search & other properties. The TAC rate on Google Search & other revenues increased from the three months 
ended March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025  primarily due to increases related to mobile 
searches, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The 
TAC rate on Google Network revenues  decreased from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 due to a combination of factors, none of which were individually significant.
The increase in other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2025  was primarily due to increases in content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube,  
depreciation expense, and other technical infrastructure operations costs.

Google advertising revenues
Google Search & other
Google Search & other revenues increased $4.5 billion from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the 
three months ended March 31, 2025 . The overall growth was driven by interrelated factors including increases in 
search queries resulting from growth in user adoption and usage on mobile devices; growth in advertiser spending; 
and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased $837 million  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 . The growth was driven by our direct response advertising products followed by our 
brand advertising products, both of which benefited from increased spending by our advertisers.
Google Network
Google Network revenues decreased $157 million from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025 , primarily due to the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates and a 
decrease in Google Ad Manager and AdMob revenues. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in 
AdSense revenues.
Monetization Metrics

Google Search & other
Paid clicks change  2 %
Cost-per-click change  7 %
Google Network
Impressions change  (5) %
Cost-per-impression change  4 %
Changes in paid clicks and impressions are driven by a number of interrelated factors, including changes in 
advertiser spending; ongoing product and policy changes; and, as it relates to paid clicks, fluctuations in search 
queries resulting from changes in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices.
Changes in cost-per-click and cost-per-impression are driven by a number of interrelated factors including 
changes in device mix, geographic mix, advertiser spending, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, 
property mix, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices
Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenu es increased $1.6 billion  from the three months ended 
March 31, 2024  to the three months ended March 31, 2025 . The growth was primarily driven by an increase in 
subscription revenues. The increase in subscript ion revenues was primarily due to growth in the number of paid 
subscribers across both YouTube services and Google One.  
Google Cloud
Google Cloud revenues increased $2.7 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2024  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2025  primarily driven by growth in Google Cloud Platform largely from infrastructure 
services.

"Analyze how increases in TAC, content costs, and depreciation jointly influenced Q1 2025 cost/revenue %, including shift drivers.",,"In Q1 2025, total cost of revenues rose by $2.6 billion (8%) to $36.4 billion, reducing the cost/revenue ratio from 42% to 40% year over year. This increase was driven primarily by higher Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC, up $802 million), greater content acquisition costs (mainly for YouTube), and higher depreciation and other technical infrastructure expenses.

The TAC rate declined from 21.0% to 20.6%, mainly due to a revenue mix shift from Google Network properties toward Google Search & other properties, which have higher growth and slightly lower TAC rates. However, the TAC rate on Google Search & other did rise, linked to more mobile searches, which incur higher TAC due to paid access points.

Overall, while growth in TAC, content, and depreciation costs raised total costs, the cost/revenue ratio improved due to total revenues increasing faster—driven by strong gains in Google Services and Cloud revenues, and favorable shifts in revenue mix.","The following table presents the foreign currency exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues

2025, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to 
provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the 
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s 
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our 
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required 
disclosure.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter 
ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls 
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving 
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that 
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of 
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the 
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter 
ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control

and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving 
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that 
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of 
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

"How did combined changes in treasury stock, retained earnings, and OCI reach $4,420M Q2’24 equity?",,"The Q2 2024 equity of $4,420 million was reached through the following combined changes:

- **Retained earnings** increased to $87,357 million, primarily from net earnings ($8,161 million for six months), minus dividends paid ($4,460 million).
- **Treasury stock** increased in cost to $(95,971) million, mainly from share repurchases, reducing equity.
- **Accumulated other comprehensive loss (OCI)** increased to $(787) million, largely due to negative foreign currency translation and cash flow hedge adjustments.

These, along with common stock ($90 million) and paid-in capital ($13,731 million), sum to $4,420 million in equity as reported, because treasury stock and accumulated losses offset the large retained earnings and paid-in capital balances.","Table of Contents

Explain how SECTION 9.09 distinguishes individual Bank debts and prevents group legal liability among Banks.,,"SECTION 9.09 makes clear that each Bank's obligations under the Agreement are several, not joint. This means each Bank is only responsible for its own commitments and debts, not for those of any other Bank. The Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or any similar entity among the Banks. Each Bank’s amount payable is a separate, independent debt, and each Bank can enforce its own rights without requiring other Banks to join any legal proceedings. This structure prevents group legal liability, ensuring no Bank is held liable for the actions or obligations of another.","SECTION 9.09. Obligations Several. The obligations of each Bank hereunder are several, and no Bank shall be
responsible for the obligations or commitment of any other Bank hereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action
taken by the Banks pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Banks to be a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity. The amounts payable at any time hereunder to each Bank shall be a separate and independent debt, and each
Bank shall be entitled to protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and it shall not be
necessary for any other Bank to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

proceeding or cause of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise and whether at law or in equity) based upon, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State
of New York. Each of the parties hereto hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, in furtherance of the foregoing
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, any claims brought against the Administrative Agent by any
party relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the consummation or administration of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

of the other Loan Documents should be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby and shall be enforced to the

SECTION 9.12. Interest. In no event shall the amount of interest, and all charges, amounts or fees contracted for,
charged or collected pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan Documents and deemed to be interest under applicable
law (collectively, “Interest”) exceed the highest rate of interest allowed by applicable law (the “Maximum Rate”), and in the event
any such payment is inadvertently received by any Bank, then the excess sum (the “Excess”) shall be credited as a payment of

of that which may legally be paid by the Borrower under applicable law. The right to accelerate maturity of any of the Loans does
not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Administrative
Agent and the Banks do not intend to collect any unearned interest in the event of any such acceleration. All monies paid to the
Administrative Agent or the Banks hereunder or under any of the Notes or the other Loan Documents, whether at maturity or by
prepayment, shall be subject to rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by applicable law. By the execution of this
Agreement, the Borrower covenants that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by the Borrower of such
Excess, and (ii) the Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable against the Administrative Agent or any

principal, unless the Borrower shall notify such Bank in writing that it elects to have the Excess returned forthwith. It is the express
intent hereof that the Borrower not pay and the Banks not receive, directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess
of that which may legally be paid by the Borrower under applicable law. The right to accelerate maturity of any of the Loans does
not include the right to accelerate any interest that has not otherwise accrued on the date of such acceleration, and the Administrative
Agent and the Banks do not intend to collect any unearned interest in the event of any such acceleration. All monies paid to the
Administrative Agent or the Banks hereunder or under any of the Notes or the other Loan Documents, whether at maturity or by
prepayment, shall be subject to rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by applicable law. By the execution of this
Agreement, the Borrower covenants that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by the Borrower of such
Excess, and (ii) the Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable against the Administrative Agent or any
Bank, based in whole or in part upon contracting for charging or receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. For the
purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by the Administrative Agent or any
Bank, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from the Borrower in connection with this Agreement, the Notes or
any of the other Loan Documents shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in
equal parts throughout the full term of the Commitments. The Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Bank shall, to the
maximum extent permitted under applicable law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather
than as Interest and (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof. The provisions of this Section shall be deemed to be
incorporated into each Note and each of the other Loan Documents (whether or not any provision of this Section is referred to
therein). All such Loan Documents and communications relating to any Interest owed by the Borrower and all figures set forth
therein shall, for the sole purpose of computing the extent of obligations hereunder and under the Notes and the other Loan
Documents be automatically recomputed by the Borrower, and by any court considering the same, to give effect to the adjustments
or credits required by this Section.

"Describe the multi-step process PEP uses to derive organic revenue and FCF with constant currency, non-GAAP, and inflationary economy considerations.",,"PepsiCo (PEP) derives organic revenue and free cash flow (FCF) through a multi-step process that incorporates constant currency adjustments, non-GAAP measures, and considerations for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies:

**Organic Revenue:**
1. **Start with Net Revenue:** Begin with total net revenue.
2. **Adjust for Foreign Exchange:** Apply constant currency calculations by removing the impact of foreign exchange translation. For 2025 onwards, this method is extended to subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies by recalculating results using prior-year exchange rates.
3. **Exclude Acquisitions/Divestitures/53rd Week:** Exclude the impact of business acquisitions, divestitures, and, if applicable, an extra reporting week.
4. **Result:** The adjusted figure—removing currency, acquisitions, and calendar anomalies—is reported as organic revenue, providing a clearer view of ongoing business performance.

**Free Cash Flow (FCF):**
1. **Start with Net Cash from Operating Activities:** Use cash generated from operations.
2. **Subtract Capital Spending:** Deduct capital expenditures required for business operations and innovation.
3. **Add Sales of Property, Plant, and Equipment:** Include proceeds from asset sales.
4. **Result:** The net result is free cash flow, used primarily for acquisitions, debt repayment, dividends, and share repurchases. FCF excludes non-discretionary obligations (e.g., debt service), so it is not total available cash.

**Additional Notes:**
- These non-GAAP measures exclude mark-to-market impacts on commodity derivatives, restructuring/impairment charges, certain acquisition/divestiture costs, and product recall effects.
- Constant currency adjustments are now also applied to highly inflationary economies, further enhancing comparability across periods.

**Summary:**  
PEP adjusts reported figures for currency fluctuations (including inflationary economies), specific one-off items, and structural changes to derive organic revenue and FCF, ensuring results reflect ongoing operational performance rather than external or extraordinary factors.","are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,”

Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain
Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the 
open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through 
the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, 
including swaps and futures. A n umber of external factors, including volatile geopolitical conditions , the 
inflationary cost environment , imp ort/export restrictions and tariffs, adverse weather conditions and 
supply chain disruptions, have impacted and may continue to impact commodity, transportation and labor

24|Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Our Segments
Basis of Presentation
When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. 
and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial 
information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-
Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete 
financial statements. We have subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, such as Argentina, 
Egypt and Turkey, and accordingly apply highly inflationary accounting for these subsidiaries. The 
condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024  has been derived from the audited 
consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes 
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a 
basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024  ( 2024 Form 10-K). This report should be read in 
conjunction with our 2024 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and 
recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 22, 2025 
are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly 
related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost 
of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, 
are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
While our financial results in the United States and Canada ( North America) are reported on a 12-week 
basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of  
January and February  are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended  March 22, 2025  and March 23, 
2024.
The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from 
volatile geopolitica l conditi ons, expanded or re taliatory tariffs  and changes in the interest rate and 
inflationary cost environment have made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. 
Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. 
Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated 
annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as 
applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. 
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts 
reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded 
amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the 
current year presentation.

8|Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered 
in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In 
addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP 
measures presented by other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below:
Organic revenue performance
We define organic revenue performance as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange 
translation (on a constant currency basis, as defined  below), acquisitions and divestitures, and where 
applicable, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week. Beginning with our first quarter of  2025, on a 
prospective basis, we are also applying the constant currency calculation for our subsidiaries operating in 
highly inflationary econ omies. We believe organic revenue performance provides useful information in 
evaluating the results of our business because it adjusts for items that we believe are not indicative of 
ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 
See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Performance” in “Results of Operations – Segment Review” for 
further information.
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical 
benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for 
items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share 
– diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth 
rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed 
commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges 
related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures and 
product recall-related imp act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of 
these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per 
common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, 
which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for 
translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our 
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the 
current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by 
the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. In addition, beginning with our first quarter of 2025, on a 
prospective basis, we are also applying the constant currency calculation for our subsidiaries operating in 
highly inflationary economies . We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the 
results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing 
performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 
Free cash flow
We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, 
plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and 
maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As 
such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from 
operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, 
including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash 
available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt 
service that are not deducted from the measure. 
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

"How might inflation, tariffs, or supply chain disruptions directly impact PepsiCo’s cost of sales and profits?",,"Inflation, tariffs, and supply chain disruptions can directly increase PepsiCo’s cost of sales by raising the prices of raw materials, transportation, labor, and other inputs. These higher costs may reduce gross profit and operating profit if PepsiCo is unable to offset them through pricing or cost management. Volatile geopolitical conditions and tariffs can further impact input costs and commodity prices, leading to greater uncertainty in financial results and profitability.","are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,”

Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain
Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the 
open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through 
the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, 
including swaps and futures. A n umber of external factors, including volatile geopolitical conditions , the 
inflationary cost environment , imp ort/export restrictions and tariffs, adverse weather conditions and 
supply chain disruptions, have impacted and may continue to impact commodity, transportation and labor

Basis of Presentation
When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. 
and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for interim financial 
information and with the rules and regulations for reporting the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Form 10-
Q). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete 
financial statements. We have subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, such as Argentina, 
Egypt and Turkey, and accordingly apply highly inflationary accounting for these subsidiaries. The 
condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2024  has been derived from the audited 
consolidated financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes 
required by GAAP for complete financial statements. These financial statements have been prepared on a 
basis that is substantially consistent with the accounting principles applied in our Annual Report on Form 
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024  ( 2024 Form 10-K). This report should be read in 
conjunction with our 2024 Form 10-K. In our opinion, these financial statements include all normal and 
recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the 12 weeks ended March 22, 2025 
are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period or the full year.
Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly 
related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost 
of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, 
are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
While our financial results in the United States and Canada ( North America) are reported on a 12-week 
basis, all of our international operations are reported on a monthly calendar basis for which the months of  
January and February  are reflected in our results for the 12 weeks ended  March 22, 2025  and March 23, 
2024.
The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial 
statements and related disclosures. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from 
volatile geopolitica l conditi ons, expanded or re taliatory tariffs  and changes in the interest rate and 
inflationary cost environment have made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. 
Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. 
Our significant interim accounting policies include the recognition of a pro rata share of certain estimated 
annual sales incentives and certain advertising and marketing costs in proportion to revenue or volume, as 
applicable, and the recognition of income taxes using an estimated annual effective tax rate. 
Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts 
reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded 
amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s financial statements to conform to the 
current year presentation.

8|Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered 
in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In 
addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP 
measures presented by other companies.
The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-Q are discussed below:
Organic revenue performance
We define organic revenue performance as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange 
translation (on a constant currency basis, as defined  below), acquisitions and divestitures, and where 
applicable, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week. Beginning with our first quarter of  2025, on a 
prospective basis, we are also applying the constant currency calculation for our subsidiaries operating in 
highly inflationary econ omies. We believe organic revenue performance provides useful information in 
evaluating the results of our business because it adjusts for items that we believe are not indicative of 
ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 
See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Performance” in “Results of Operations – Segment Review” for 
further information.
Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical 
benefits income, provision for income taxes and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for 
items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share 
– diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability and the corresponding constant currency growth 
rates
These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed 
commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges 
related to our 2019 Productivity Plan, charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures and 
product recall-related imp act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of 
these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per 
common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis, 
which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for 
translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our 
constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the 
current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by 
the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. In addition, beginning with our first quarter of 2025, on a 
prospective basis, we are also applying the constant currency calculation for our subsidiaries operating in 
highly inflationary economies . We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the 
results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing 
performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. 
Free cash flow
We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, 
plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and 
maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As 
such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from 
operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, 
including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash 
available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt 
service that are not deducted from the measure. 
See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.

"How do GAAP, mngmt estimates, and intl vs N.A. reporting periods impact PepsiCo’s interim FS prep?",,"PepsiCo’s interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which establishes the framework and requirements for presenting financial information. Management estimates and assumptions are necessary in preparing these statements, especially given current economic and geopolitical uncertainties, making estimates more challenging and subject to potential differences between actual and estimated outcomes.

Additionally, reporting periods differ between North America (reported on a 12-week basis) and international operations (reported on a monthly calendar basis), which means that results for international operations reflect the months of January and February within each interim period. This difference must be considered for consistency and comparability. Overall, GAAP, management’s judgment in applying estimates, and varying reporting periods all influence the content and comparability of PepsiCo’s interim financial statements.","are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,”

Analyze how the interplay of digital channels and increased retailer power affects both unit volume and operating profit.,,"The shift towards digital channels, such as e-commerce and mobile applications, increases consumer access and purchasing, which can help sustain or grow unit volume. However, the growing power of consolidated retailers and buying groups, especially in key markets like North America and Europe, gives them greater influence over pricing and margin negotiations. This increased retailer power can limit the company's ability to compete and negatively impact operating profit. Recent results show unit volume is pressured—net revenue and operating profit declined by 2% and 5% respectively year-over-year—suggesting that while digital channels present opportunities, the increasingly powerful retailers may be exerting downward pressure on profitability.","Retail Landscape
Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth 
in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription 
services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion 
of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-
offline and other online purchasing by consumers. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape 
and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as 
expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and 
emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results.
The retail industry also continues to be impacted by the actions and increasing power of retailers,

Compare the objectives and financial impact of the 2019 Productivity Plan vs. its 2030 extension.,,"The 2019 Productivity Plan aimed to leverage new technology and business models to simplify, harmonize, and automate processes, re-engineer go-to-market and information systems, and optimize manufacturing and supply chain footprints. The objectives centered on efficiency, automation, and organizational simplification.

In 2024, the plan was expanded and extended through 2030 to capitalize on further opportunities within these same initiatives. The extension continues the original objectives but increases both the scale and duration of the efforts.

Financially, the total expected pre-tax charges for the plan (including the extension) are approximately $6.15 billion, with about $5.1 billion in cash expenditures. As of March 22, 2025, $2.8 billion in pre-tax charges (including $2.1 billion cash expenditures) had been incurred. The majority of remaining costs are expected by 2027, with the rest through 2030. The charges consist of about 55% severance and employee costs, 10% non-cash asset impairments, and 35% other implementation costs.

In summary, the 2030 extension builds on the same core objectives as the original 2019 plan, but broadens the initiative and increases total anticipated costs to capture additional efficiency opportunities.","Restructuring and Impairment Charges
2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
The 2019 Productivity Plan leverages new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize 
and automate processes; re-engineers our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the  
right automation for each market; and simplifies our organization and optimizes our manufacturing and 
supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in 2024, 
we further expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2030 to take advantage of additional 
opportunities within the initiatives described above.  As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of 
approximately $6.15 billion , including cash expenditures of approximately $5.1 billion . Plan-to-date 
through March 22, 2025, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $2.8 billion, including cash expenditures of 
$2.1 billion . We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures

Our Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit 
facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper 
borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing 
needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include 
cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash 
and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and 
long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; 
operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures 
and the transition tax liability under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJ Act). In addition, these sources of 
cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not 
have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we

"Analyze how certifying officers interrelate ICFR design, evaluation, and disclosure processes to comply with SEC, SOX.",,"Certifying officers, such as the CEO and CFO, interrelate the design, evaluation, and disclosure of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) to comply with SEC and SOX requirements by:

1. **Design**: They are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate ICFR and disclosure controls (per Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)/(f) and 15d-15(e)/(f)). This includes designing or supervising the design of controls to provide reasonable assurance of reliable financial reporting.

2. **Evaluation**: Officers conduct regular evaluations of the effectiveness of these controls, presenting conclusions about their effectiveness in their reports, as of the end of the covered period.

3. **Disclosure**: They must disclose any material changes, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses in ICFR that could affect the company’s ability to process or report financial information. All such findings are communicated to auditors and the audit committee.

This integrated approach ensures that financial statements are fairly presented and that the company’s reporting processes meet all SEC and SOX compliance obligations.","EXHIBIT 31

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
(unaudited)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership
warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-
label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At
February 16, 2025, Costco operated 897 warehouses worldwide: 617 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states,
Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 19 in
Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and
Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and
Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in
consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to
Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31.
Fiscal 2025 is a 52-week year ending on August 31, 2025. References to the second quarter of 2025 and 2024 relate to the
12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024. References to the first half of 2025 and 2024 relate
to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect; the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are
reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated balance sheet for 2024 and to the statement of cash flows for the
first half of 2024. These changes were made to conform with the current year presentation.

Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership
warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-

Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in
consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to
Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31.
Fiscal 2025 is a 52-week year ending on August 31, 2025. References to the second quarter of 2025 and 2024 relate to the
12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024. References to the first half of 2025 and 2024 relate
to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect; the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are
reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated balance sheet for 2024 and to the statement of cash flows for the

Analyze implications of adopting a floating fiscal year-end on multi-national retailer’s financial comparability.,,"Adopting a floating fiscal year-end, as Costco does (ending on the Sunday closest to August 31), may impact financial comparability for a multi-national retailer in several ways:

1. **Alignment with Operational Cycles:** Using a 52/53 week fiscal year helps better align financial reporting with core business operations and inventory turnover cycles, providing a more accurate picture of performance and seasonality.

2. **Comparability Challenges:** Fiscal periods may not align precisely with calendar years or with other companies using standard fiscal year-ends (e.g., December 31), potentially complicating direct peer comparisons, especially across international subsidiaries operating in different retail cycles or tax jurisdictions.

3. **Consistency in Year-Over-Year Analysis:** Because some years have 53 weeks, year-over-year comparisons (such as sales or expenses) can be skewed if the extra week is not disclosed or adjusted for, requiring careful explanation in financial reporting.

4. **Tax and Regulatory Impacts:** Multi-national operations may face issues with local tax and regulatory reporting, which often require calendar-based filings, leading to the need for reconciliations and increased administrative complexity.

Overall, a floating fiscal year-end improves internal operational alignment but requires transparent disclosure and possible reconciliations for accurate external comparability.","Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(amounts in millions, except share, per share, and warehouse count data)
(unaudited)
Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business
Costco Wholesale Corporation (Costco or the Company), a Washington corporation, and its subsidiaries operate membership
warehouses based on the concept that offering members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-
label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. At
February 16, 2025, Costco operated 897 warehouses worldwide: 617 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states,
Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom (U.K.), 19 in
Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, and one each in Iceland, New Zealand, and
Sweden. The Company operates e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and
Australia.
Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in
consolidation.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to
Form 10-Q for interim financial reporting pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). While these statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for
fair presentation of the results of the interim period, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for complete financial statements. Therefore, the interim condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024.
Fiscal Year End
The Company operates on a 52/53 week fiscal year basis, with the fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31.
Fiscal 2025 is a 52-week year ending on August 31, 2025. References to the second quarter of 2025 and 2024 relate to the
12-week fiscal quarters ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024. References to the first half of 2025 and 2024 relate
to the 24 weeks ended February 16, 2025, and February 18, 2024.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect; the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These
estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are
reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.
Reclassification
Reclassifications were made to the condensed consolidated balance sheet for 2024 and to the statement of cash flows for the
first half of 2024. These changes were made to conform with the current year presentation.

Analyze the impact of multidistrict opioid litigation on Costco’s exposure to infant-related class actions.,,"Costco is named as a defendant in multidistrict opioid litigation, including class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions in 40 states. These cases increase Costco’s potential legal exposure, as class actions on behalf of infants can result in significant damages or settlements. Although some cases against Costco in certain states have been dismissed, the company continues to defend against the remaining infant-related claims. The overall impact is ongoing legal risk and possible financial liability related to these class actions.","Table of Contents
Note 7—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share
The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares
of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s):

Weighted average diluted shares 444,886 444,754 444,888 444,579 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the dilutive effect of RSUs using the treasury
stock method.
Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in many claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In
accordance with accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters
present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be actual losses in excess of
amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking
into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if
any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to some
matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at
issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but monitors for
developments that make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable
possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has
been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view,
be reasonably estimated because, among other things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; the
legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large
number of parties.
In November 2023, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for
failure to pay minimum wage, failure to pay overtime, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to provide accurate wage
statements, failure to reimburse expenses, failure to pay wages when due, and failure to pay sick pay. Martin Reyes v. Costco
Wholesale Corporation, Sacramento County Superior Court (No. 23cv011351), removed to federal court, No. 2:24-cv-00300
(E.D. Cal.). A second amended complaint was filed, which the Company has moved to dismiss. In January 2024, the same
plaintiff filed a related Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) representative action, seeking civil penalties and asserting the
same alleged underlying Labor Code violations and an additional suitable seating claim. In May 2024, the plaintiff filed an
amended PAGA complaint; the Company has denied the material allegations of the complaint and filed a motion to stay the
action. The motion was granted on December 18, 2024.
In August 2024, an employee filed an action under PAGA against the Company, alleging claims for penalties for alleged
violations of the California Labor Code regarding: off-the-clock work, incorrect and untimely payment of wages. Nader v.
Costco (No. CV-24-006198; Stanislaus County Superior Court). An
14|Table of Contents
amended complaint was filed in November 2024. In February 2025 the court granted the Company’s motion to strike portions
of the complaint; the plaintiff has permission to file a further amended complaint.
Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases
concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American
tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are
cases filed against the Company by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-
party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions
in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased
insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company filed in federal
court outside the MDL by one county in Georgia are pending, and claims filed by certain cities and counties in New York are
pending in state court, as are claims by certain county district attorneys in Pennsylvania. Claims against the Company in state
courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. Claims against the Company in federal court in
Georgia and Florida have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters except for a small number
being resolved for immaterial amounts.
Between September 25 and October 31, 2023, five class action suits were filed against the Company alleging privacy law
violations stemming from pixel trackers on Costco.com: Birdwell v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. T23-1405, Contra Costa
County Superior Court; and Scott v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-08808 (C.D. Cal.), now consolidated with R.S. v.
Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-01628 (W.D. Wash.); Groves, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-01662
(W.D. Wash.), and Castillo v. Costco Wholesale Corp., under No. 2:34-cv-01548 (W.D. Wash.). The Castillo plaintiffs filed a
consolidated complaint on January 26, 2024, which seeks damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees under various
statutes, including the Washington Consumer Protection Act, Washington Privacy Act, Washington Uniform Health Care
Information Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, and California Confidentiality of
Medical Information Act. The consolidated complaint also alleges breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, conversion,
and unjust enrichment. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Castillo complaint on March 11, 2024. In November 2024
the court denied the motion to dismiss in substantial part. On May 16, 2024, the parties stipulated to stay Birdwell pending
resolution of Castillo. On January 2, and August 22, 2024, the Company received related civil investigative demands from the
Washington Attorney General's Office. On January 3, 2024, the Company received a related pre-litigation letter from the Los
Angeles Office of the County Counsel. The Company is in the process of responding to both agencies.
On June 20, 2024, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Company and Nice-Pak Products, Inc., alleging that Kirkland
Signature Fragrance Free Baby Wipes contain 3.7 parts per billion of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The complaint
alleges that the label claim that the wipes are “made with naturally derived ingredients” thus violates various state consumer
protection and false advertising laws. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages, as well as
equitable relief and attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 9, 2024. Bullard, et ano., v.
Costco Wholesale Corp., et ano., No. 3:24-cv-03714 (N.D. Cal.). On February 14, 2025, the court granted this motion;
plaintiffs have permission to file an amended complaint.
The Company has been served in over seventy product liability cases in California and Oregon related to its alleged sale of
artificial and natural stone countertops. These lawsuits allege strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, fraud, and failure
to warn claims on the grounds that the fabricators and cutters of the stone slabs used to fabricate countertops offered for sale
by Costco are exposed to silica particulates in the air while performing such work, allegedly causing lung diseases, including,
but not limited to, silicosis. The defendants in these cases include the manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. The Company
denied all claims, has filed cross-claims pertaining to indemnity and contribution, and otherwise sought indemnity from
responsible parties and has now been dismissed from nearly all of these cases.

"How do labor, privacy, and product-related class actions and regulatory claims against Costco since 2023 differ?",,"Labor, privacy, and product-related class actions and regulatory claims against Costco since 2023 differ as follows:

- **Labor Claims:** These focus on alleged violations of California labor laws, such as failure to pay minimum wage or overtime, inaccurate wage statements, unreimbursed expenses, untimely wage payments, lack of meal/rest breaks, and suitable seating (e.g., Martin Reyes v. Costco and Nader v. Costco). They often proceed as class actions or Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) cases, seeking unpaid wages and/or civil penalties.

- **Privacy Claims:** These center around alleged privacy violations related to digital data practices, particularly involving Costco.com’s use of pixel trackers. Plaintiffs claim breaches of various state and federal privacy laws (including the Washington Consumer Protection and Privacy Acts and the California Invasion of Privacy Act), and seek damages, equitable relief, and attorney fees. These cases have also triggered regulatory inquiries from state agencies.

- **Product-Related Claims:** These involve allegations regarding product safety or labeling, such as lawsuits over traces of PFAS chemicals in baby wipes (Bullard v. Costco), and strict liability claims related to silica exposure from stone countertops. The claims assert breach of warranty, negligence, fraud, and failure to warn, focus on potential health impacts or false advertising, and may involve large numbers of plaintiffs (such as over seventy product liability cases in California and Oregon).

In summary: labor claims target workplace practices and compensation, privacy claims address digital data and consumer information, while product-related cases concern product safety/labeling and physical harm.","Table of Contents

The Company has been served in over seventy product liability cases in California and Oregon related to its alleged sale of
artificial and natural stone countertops. These lawsuits allege strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, fraud, and failure
to warn claims on the grounds that the fabricators and cutters of the stone slabs used to fabricate countertops offered for sale
by Costco are exposed to silica particulates in the air while performing such work, allegedly causing lung diseases, including,
but not limited to, silicosis. The defendants in these cases include the manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. The Company
denied all claims, has filed cross-claims pertaining to indemnity and contribution, and otherwise sought indemnity from
responsible parties and has now been dismissed from nearly all of these cases.

How are immaterial accruals determined when class actions involve both subsidiaries and indemnification agreements?,,"Immaterial accruals are determined based on accounting guidance, which requires the company to record an accrual for legal proceedings only if a loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable. The company monitors ongoing developments, including the involvement of subsidiaries and any indemnification arrangements with suppliers or insurers, to reassess the likelihood and potential amount of loss. Immaterial accruals are recorded when the estimated potential loss is not significant. If the loss cannot be both reliably quantified and is not probable, no accrual is made, but the matters are continually monitored for changes that could make a loss probable and reasonably estimable.","Table of Contents
Note 7—Net Income per Common and Common Equivalent Share
The following table shows the amounts used in computing net income per share and the weighted average number of shares
of basic and of potentially dilutive common shares outstanding (shares in 000s):
12 Weeks Ended 24 Weeks Ended

Weighted average basic shares 443,982 443,892 443,985 443,859 
RSUs 904 862 903 720 
Weighted average diluted shares 444,886 444,754 444,888 444,579 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated based on the dilutive effect of RSUs using the treasury
stock method.
Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved in many claims, proceedings and litigations arising from its business and property ownership. In
accordance with accounting guidance, the Company establishes an accrual for legal proceedings if and when those matters
present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. There may be actual losses in excess of
amounts accrued. The Company monitors those matters for developments that would affect the likelihood of a loss (taking
into account where applicable indemnification arrangements concerning suppliers and insurers) and the accrued amount, if
any, thereof, and adjusts the amount as appropriate. The Company has recorded an immaterial accrual with respect to some
matters described below, in addition to other immaterial accruals for matters not described below. If the loss contingency at
issue is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrual, but monitors for
developments that make the contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. In each case, there is a reasonable
possibility that a loss may be incurred, including a loss in excess of the applicable accrual. For matters where no accrual has
been recorded, the possible loss or range of loss (including any loss in excess of the accrual) cannot, in the Company's view,
be reasonably estimated because, among other things: the remedies or penalties sought are indeterminate or unspecified; the
legal and/or factual theories are not well developed; and/or the matters involve complex or novel legal theories or a large
number of parties.
In November 2023, a former employee filed a class action against the Company alleging claims under California law for
failure to pay minimum wage, failure to pay overtime, failure to provide meal and rest breaks, failure to provide accurate wage
statements, failure to reimburse expenses, failure to pay wages when due, and failure to pay sick pay. Martin Reyes v. Costco
Wholesale Corporation, Sacramento County Superior Court (No. 23cv011351), removed to federal court, No. 2:24-cv-00300
(E.D. Cal.). A second amended complaint was filed, which the Company has moved to dismiss. In January 2024, the same
plaintiff filed a related Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) representative action, seeking civil penalties and asserting the
same alleged underlying Labor Code violations and an additional suitable seating claim. In May 2024, the plaintiff filed an
amended PAGA complaint; the Company has denied the material allegations of the complaint and filed a motion to stay the
action. The motion was granted on December 18, 2024.
In August 2024, an employee filed an action under PAGA against the Company, alleging claims for penalties for alleged
violations of the California Labor Code regarding: off-the-clock work, incorrect and untimely payment of wages. Nader v.
Costco (No. CV-24-006198; Stanislaus County Superior Court). An

amended complaint was filed in November 2024. In February 2025 the court granted the Company’s motion to strike portions
of the complaint; the plaintiff has permission to file a further amended complaint.
Beginning in December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases
concerning the impacts of opioid abuses filed against various defendants by counties, cities, hospitals, Native American
tribes, third-party payors, and others. In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (N.D. Ohio). Included are
cases filed against the Company by counties and cities in Michigan, New Jersey, Oregon, Virginia and South Carolina, a third-
party payor in Ohio, and a hospital in Texas, class actions filed on behalf of infants born with opioid-related medical conditions
in 40 states, and class actions and individual actions filed on behalf of individuals seeking to recover alleged increased
insurance costs associated with opioid abuse in 43 states and American Samoa. Claims against the Company filed in federal
court outside the MDL by one county in Georgia are pending, and claims filed by certain cities and counties in New York are
pending in state court, as are claims by certain county district attorneys in Pennsylvania. Claims against the Company in state
courts in New Jersey, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona have been dismissed. Claims against the Company in federal court in
Georgia and Florida have been dismissed. The Company is defending all of the pending matters except for a small number
being resolved for immaterial amounts.
Between September 25 and October 31, 2023, five class action suits were filed against the Company alleging privacy law
violations stemming from pixel trackers on Costco.com: Birdwell v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. T23-1405, Contra Costa
County Superior Court; and Scott v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-08808 (C.D. Cal.), now consolidated with R.S. v.
Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-01628 (W.D. Wash.); Groves, et ano., v. Costco Wholesale Corp., No. 2:23-cv-01662
(W.D. Wash.), and Castillo v. Costco Wholesale Corp., under No. 2:34-cv-01548 (W.D. Wash.). The Castillo plaintiffs filed a
consolidated complaint on January 26, 2024, which seeks damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees under various
statutes, including the Washington Consumer Protection Act, Washington Privacy Act, Washington Uniform Health Care
Information Act, Electronic Communications Privacy Act, California Invasion of Privacy Act, and California Confidentiality of
Medical Information Act. The consolidated complaint also alleges breach of implied contract, invasion of privacy, conversion,
and unjust enrichment. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the Castillo complaint on March 11, 2024. In November 2024
the court denied the motion to dismiss in substantial part. On May 16, 2024, the parties stipulated to stay Birdwell pending
resolution of Castillo. On January 2, and August 22, 2024, the Company received related civil investigative demands from the
Washington Attorney General's Office. On January 3, 2024, the Company received a related pre-litigation letter from the Los
Angeles Office of the County Counsel. The Company is in the process of responding to both agencies.
On June 20, 2024, a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Company and Nice-Pak Products, Inc., alleging that Kirkland
Signature Fragrance Free Baby Wipes contain 3.7 parts per billion of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances. The complaint
alleges that the label claim that the wipes are “made with naturally derived ingredients” thus violates various state consumer
protection and false advertising laws. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including punitive damages, as well as
equitable relief and attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on August 9, 2024. Bullard, et ano., v.

"Assess how Q2 2025’s 9% net sales rise was influenced by comparable sales, 23 new warehouses, gasoline price/vol fluctuations, and fx changes, while noting effects by region (US, Canada, Intl).",,"Q2 2025’s 9% net sales increase to $62,530 was primarily driven by strong comparable sales growth (+7% company-wide) and sales from 23 net new warehouses opened since Q2 2024. Regionally, the US saw an 11% net sales rise (8% comparable sales), Canada 5% net sales (5% comparable), and Other International 5% net sales (2% comparable). Lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $56 (10 basis points) due to a 3% drop in per-gallon price, though a 1% increase in gasoline volume had a small positive effect (+$51, nine basis points). Foreign currency (fx) changes had a significant negative impact, reducing net sales by approximately $1,244 (217 basis points), notably in international and Canadian operations. Overall, the sales gain was led by core merchandise and augmented by new warehouse openings, while lower gasoline prices and fx fluctuations partly offset growth, especially outside the US.","Table of Contents
business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. The 2% reward
associated with Executive membership is allocated to the category in which the reward is generated (core merchandise
categories, warehouse ancillary, and other businesses). Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for
more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for
more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the
amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors
that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations) and inflation
or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these
items, the more we can leverage our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of
sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available the right
merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another
substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation
or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is
vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with
e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we
believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to
our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.
Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-
term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our
“pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our net sales and gross margin are influenced in part
by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited
to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, as
well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on
merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the
increases on to our members, negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross
margin percentage) in the near term. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, has a lower gross-margin
percentage than our warehouse operations.
We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses; it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and
lower SG&A expense relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our
gross margin percentage. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base,
negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in
gasoline prices has the inverse effect.
Government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China, Mexico, Canada and the United States, affect
the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods,
rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs are more likely to adversely impact rather than improve our results.
We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites
become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.
Negative aspects of such growth include lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization
of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets. Our rate of square footage growth is generally
higher in many of our foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.

The membership format is an integral part of our business and profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member
loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the
penetration of Executive memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-
membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to
new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate may be adversely impacted by memberships in newer international markets and a
higher penetration of memberships sold online, both of which typically renew at a lower rate.
Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this
area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the
compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that
achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee
satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce.
This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.
Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of
income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note
9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other
International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of
sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.
In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our
international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the
current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the
difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon. Results expressed excluding the impacts of
foreign-exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S.

(1) Comparable sales for the second quarter and first half of 2024 were calculated using comparable retail weeks.
Net Sales
Net sales increased $5,199 or 9%, and $9,467 or 8% during the second quarter and first half of 2025. The improvement was
attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at the 23 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second
quarter of 2024. Sales increased $4,786 or 10% and $9,119, or 10% in core merchandise categories during the second
quarter and first half of 2025, increasing in all categories. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased $413
or 4%, and $348, or 2% during the second quarter and first half of 2025, led by pharmacy, partially offset by lower gasoline
prices.
During the second quarter of 2025, lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $56, 10 basis points, compared to
2024, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%,
positively impacting net sales by $51, or nine basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively
impacted net sales by approximately $1,244, or 217 basis points, attributable to our Other International and Canadian
operations.
During the first half of 2025, lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $964, 85 basis points, compared to 2024,
with an 8% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively
impacting net sales by $132, or 12 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted
net sales by approximately $1,408, or 123 basis points, attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations.

Compare the impact of falling gasoline prices vs. adverse FX rates on Costco’s 2025 net sales growth.,,"In 2025, falling gasoline prices had a negative impact on Costco’s net sales, but the adverse impact from foreign exchange (FX) rates was significantly greater. Specifically, in the second quarter of 2025, lower gasoline prices reduced net sales by $56 (10 basis points), while negative FX movements reduced net sales by approximately $1,244 (217 basis points). Similarly, for the first half of 2025, lower gasoline prices reduced net sales by $964 (85 basis points), while FX rates reduced net sales by about $1,408 (123 basis points). Thus, adverse FX rates had a much larger negative effect on net sales growth than falling gasoline prices.","Table of Contents

Net Sales
Net sales increased $5,199 or 9%, and $9,467 or 8% during the second quarter and first half of 2025. The improvement was
attributable to an increase in comparable sales and sales at the 23 net new warehouses opened since the end of the second
quarter of 2024. Sales increased $4,786 or 10% and $9,119, or 10% in core merchandise categories during the second
quarter and first half of 2025, increasing in all categories. Sales in warehouse ancillary and other businesses increased $413
or 4%, and $348, or 2% during the second quarter and first half of 2025, led by pharmacy, partially offset by lower gasoline
prices.
During the second quarter of 2025, lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $56, 10 basis points, compared to
2024, with a 3% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%,
positively impacting net sales by $51, or nine basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively
impacted net sales by approximately $1,244, or 217 basis points, attributable to our Other International and Canadian
operations.
During the first half of 2025, lower gasoline prices negatively impacted net sales by $964, 85 basis points, compared to 2024,
with an 8% decrease in the average price per gallon. The volume of gasoline sold increased approximately 1%, positively
impacting net sales by $132, or 12 basis points. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted
net sales by approximately $1,408, or 123 basis points, attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations.

Excluding the effects of changes in gasoline prices and foreign currency, e-commerce comparable sales increased 22%, compared to total company comparable sales growth of 9%.","Table of Contents
business center sales are allocated to the appropriate merchandise categories in the Net Sales discussion. The 2% reward
associated with Executive membership is allocated to the category in which the reward is generated (core merchandise
categories, warehouse ancillary, and other businesses). Comparable sales is defined as net sales from warehouses open for
more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce sites operating for
more than one year. The measure is intended as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing members and the
amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors
that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to our international operations) and inflation
or deflation in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these
items, the more we can leverage our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of
sales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available the right
merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another
substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation
or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is
vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with
e-commerce operations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we
believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to
our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.
Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices. We do not focus in the short-
term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our
“pricing authority” – consistently providing the most competitive values. Our net sales and gross margin are influenced in part
by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited
to, working with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes, as
well as passing cost increases on to our members. Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on
merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the
increases on to our members, negatively impacting gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross
margin percentage) in the near term. Our e-commerce business, domestically and internationally, has a lower gross-margin
percentage than our warehouse operations.
We believe our gasoline business enhances traffic in our warehouses; it generally has a lower gross margin percentage and
lower SG&A expense relative to our non-gasoline businesses. A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our
gross margin percentage. Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base,
negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in
gasoline prices has the inverse effect.
Government actions in various countries relating to tariffs, particularly China, Mexico, Canada and the United States, affect
the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods,
rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs are more likely to adversely impact rather than improve our results.
We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites
become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.
Negative aspects of such growth include lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization
of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets. Our rate of square footage growth is generally
higher in many of our foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.

The membership format is an integral part of our business and profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member
loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the
penetration of Executive memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-
membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to
new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate may be adversely impacted by memberships in newer international markets and a
higher penetration of memberships sold online, both of which typically renew at a lower rate.
Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this
area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the
compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that
achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee
satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce.
This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.
Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of
income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note
9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other
International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of
sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.
In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our
international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the
current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the
difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon. Results expressed excluding the impacts of
foreign-exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be reviewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S.

Evaluate how FX fluctuations differently affected warehouse segment margins and SG&A in non-U.S. markets.,,"Foreign exchange (FX) fluctuations negatively impacted both gross margins and SG&A expenses in non-U.S. (Canadian and Other International) markets, but in different ways. FX changes reduced gross margin by approximately $135 in the second quarter and $158 year-to-date, primarily attributed to Other International and Canadian operations. This reflects lower reported gross margins in those regions when translating local results to U.S. dollars.

In contrast, FX fluctuations decreased SG&A expenses by about $85 in the second quarter and $93 year-to-date for these same non-U.S. segments. This means that when translated from local currencies to U.S. dollars, reported SG&A expense appeared lower.

In summary, FX fluctuations had a negative impact on reported warehouse segment gross margins, but a positive impact (lower reported expense) on SG&A in non-U.S. markets.","Table of Contents

segment gross margin percentage decreased, primarily due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by
warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin decreased in our Other International segment, primarily due to
decreases in core merchandise categories.
Year-to-date Results
Gross margin percentage increased 14 basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross
margin percentage was 10.98%, an increase of six basis points. This increase was positively impacted by 14 basis points in
our core merchandise categories, primarily due to our co-branded credit card program. This increase was partially offset by
eight basis points due to warehouse ancillary and other businesses, primarily gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce.
Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted gross margin by approximately $158, compared
to the first half of 2024, attributable to our Other International and Canadian operations.
The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than
total net sales), decreased three basis points. The decrease was primarily due to non-foods, partially offset by fresh foods and
foods and sundries.
Segment gross margin percentage increased in all segments. Our U.S. segment performed similarly to the consolidated
results above. Our Canadian and Other International segments gross margin increased, primarily due to increases in core
merchandise categories.

How did comparable sales growth vs. new warehouse openings affect Q2 2025 net sales differently?,,"In Q2 2025, net sales increased 9% to $62,530 million, driven by both comparable sales growth and sales from 23 net new warehouses opened since the prior year. Comparable sales increased 7% in the quarter, primarily due to increased shopping frequency and slightly higher average ticket. While comparable sales growth reflects increased sales in existing locations, new warehouse openings contributed additional sales from new locations. Both factors positively impacted net sales; however, comparable sales growth indicates organic growth at existing stores, whereas new warehouse openings expand total sales by adding new revenue sources.","Table of Contents

Membership fee revenue increased 7% and 8% in the second quarter and first half of 2025, primarily driven by new member
sign-ups and the fee increase (discussed below). Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted
membership fees by $22 and $23 in the second quarter and first half of 2025. At the end of the second quarter of 2025, our
renewal rates were 93.0% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.5% worldwide. Our renewal rate, which excludes affiliates of
Business members, is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the
reporting date.
As previously reported, we increased our annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 1, 2024. We
account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one-year membership period. The
recent membership fee increase contributed approximately 3% of membership fee revenue during the second quarter of
2025.

Quarterly Results
Gross margin percentage increased five basis points. Excluding the impact of gasoline price deflation on net sales, gross
margin percentage was 10.84%, an increase of four basis points. Gross margin percentage from warehouse ancillary and
other businesses was flat, primarily due to an increase in e-commerce, partially offset by a decrease in our gasoline business.
The LIFO impact was flat quarter over quarter. Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted
gross margin by approximately $135, compared to the second quarter of 2024, attributable to our Other International and
Canadian operations.
The gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than
total net sales), decreased eight basis points. The decrease was primarily due to increased supply chain costs to support
higher inventory levels and certain mix changes in our non-food categories. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in
sales penetration and gross margin from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.

The membership format is an integral part of our business and profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member
loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the
penetration of Executive memberships, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid-
membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to
new markets. Our worldwide renewal rate may be adversely impacted by memberships in newer international markets and a
higher penetration of memberships sold online, both of which typically renew at a lower rate.
Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this
area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses. With respect to the
compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that
achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover, increasing productivity and enhancing employee
satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce.
This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.
Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of
income, particularly merchandise costs and SG&A expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.
Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note
9 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Report). Certain operations in the Other
International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of
sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.
In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the
U.S. dollar, which are differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our
international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact is calculated based on the difference between the
current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the
difference between the current and prior period's average price per gallon. Results expressed excluding the impacts of
foreign-exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales

Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,434 in the first half of 2025, compared to $8,250 in the first half of 2024. Cash
flow used in financing activities during the first half of 2025 was primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of
common stock, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repayments of short-term borrowings. Cash flow provided by
financing activities included proceeds from short-term borrowings.
Dividends
A quarterly cash dividend of $1.16 per share was declared on January 23, 2025, and paid on February 21, 2025. Dividends in
the second quarter of 2024 included a special dividend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655.
Share Repurchase Program
On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires
in January 2027. During the first half of 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 443,000 and 528,000 shares of common stock, at an
average price per share of $932.03 and $609.51, totaling approximately $413 and $322. These amounts may differ from the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a
quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to
plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation
Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,452 at the end of the second quarter.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 16, 2025, we had
borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,176. Our international operations maintain $680 of this capacity under bank
credit facilities, of which $159 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit
facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of the
second quarter of 2025 and at the end of 2024.
We have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $220. The outstanding commitments
under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2025 totaled $198, most of which were standby letters of credit that
do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within
one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank
credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and
judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical
accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024. There have

realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs and the economic
environment.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities totaled $1,434 in the first half of 2025, compared to $8,250 in the first half of 2024. Cash
flow used in financing activities during the first half of 2025 was primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchases of
common stock, withholding taxes on stock-based awards, and repayments of short-term borrowings. Cash flow provided by
financing activities included proceeds from short-term borrowings.
Dividends
A quarterly cash dividend of $1.16 per share was declared on January 23, 2025, and paid on February 21, 2025. Dividends in
the second quarter of 2024 included a special dividend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655.
Share Repurchase Program
On January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires
in January 2027. During the first half of 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 443,000 and 528,000 shares of common stock, at an
average price per share of $932.03 and $609.51, totaling approximately $413 and $322. These amounts may differ from the
accompanying condensed consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of a
quarter. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant to
plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation
Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was $2,452 at the end of the second quarter.
Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs
We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At February 16, 2025, we had
borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,176. Our international operations maintain $680 of this capacity under bank
credit facilities, of which $159 is guaranteed by the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit
facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of the
second quarter of 2025 and at the end of 2024.
We have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $220. The outstanding commitments
under these facilities at the end of the second quarter of 2025 totaled $198, most of which were standby letters of credit that
do not expire or have expiration dates within one year. The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most within
one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank
credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires that we make estimates and
judgments. We base these on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable. Our critical
accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024. There have
been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates previously disclosed in that Report.

Analyze the impact of promotional activity on Foot Locker’s gross-to-operating leverage during 2023 margin compression.,,"Promotional activity negatively impacted Foot Locker’s gross-to-operating leverage during 2023. Both channels experienced declines in sales and lower gross margins due to a more promotional environment. This, combined with deleveraging (i.e., operating expenses not decreasing proportionally with sales), resulted in division profit margins falling to 3.4% (thirteen weeks) and 3.3% (thirty-nine weeks) as of October 28, 2023, from 10.1% and 10.4% in the prior-year periods. In summary, increased promotions reduced gross margin, and lower sales volume caused operating expenses to become a larger percentage of sales, compressing overall margins.","Table of Contents

"Connect higher shrink, merchandise costs, and increased promotions to changes in Foot Locker's gross margin rate.",,"Foot Locker’s gross margin rate decreased for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, primarily due to higher promotional activity, increased merchandise costs, and higher shrink. These factors led to a 370- and 310-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate for the respective periods. The increased promotions reduced the selling price of products, higher merchandise costs compressed profit margins, and increased shrink further reduced inventory value—all contributing to the overall decline in gross margin rate.","Table of Contents

Third Quarter 2023 Form 10-Q Page 8|Table of Contents The gross margin rate decreased to 27.3% for the thirteen weeks ended October 28, 2023, as compared with the corresponding prior-yearperiod, reflecting a 370-basis point decrease in the merchandise margin rate, and a 100-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers'compensation rate. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, gross margin rate decreased to 28.1%, reflecting a 310-basis pointdecrease in the merchandise margin rate and a 140-basis point deleverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate. The declines inmerchandise margin rate reflected higher promotional activity in the current marketplace, higher costs of merchandise, and increased shrink.The deleverage in the occupancy and buyers' compensation rate for both periods was primarily related to the fixed nature of these costs inrelation to the decline in sales.

As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased by 100 basis points and 130 basis points forthe thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, respectively, primarily reflecting deleverage from the decline in sales, coupledwith pressures from inflation and investments in front-line wages and technology aimed at improving the omnichannel experience andimproving customer data analytics. Partially offsetting these increases were lower incentive compensation due to the Company'sunderperformance relative to targets and savings from our cost optimization program.

 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $5 million and $9 million for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023,respectively, as compared with the corresponding prior-year periods. These declines are primarily related to operating fewer stores and theeffect from impairments recorded in the prior year. Impairment and Other For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, we incurred $1 million and $27 million of transformation consulting expense,respectively, as compared with $17 million and $27 million in the corresponding prior-year periods. For the thirteen weeks ended October 28,2023, we recorded a $3 million net benefit from the settlement of lease obligations associated with Sidestep stores, partially offset byimpairment on atmos U.S. assets of $1 million, as compared to no impairment in the prior year period.

Analyze the impact of non-cash impairment charges on multi-year trends in retail cash flow operations.,,"Non-cash impairment charges reduce reported net income, but since they do not require actual cash outflows, their direct impact on cash flow from operations is limited. Over multiple years, impairment charges can contribute to fluctuations in net income, but are added back to reconcile net income to net cash from operating activities, as shown in the adjustments section of the cash flow statement. For example, for the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, $20 million in non-cash impairment and other charges were added back, compared to $5 million in 2022. While such charges can signal declining asset values and underlying business challenges, their main cash flow impact is non-cash: they increase operating cash flow relative to net income in the periods they are recognized, and add noise to multi-year cash flow trend analysis but do not directly use company liquidity.","Table of Contents

Adjustments to net income for non-cashitems include impairment charges, other charges, fair value adjustments to minority investments, depreciation and amortization, deferredincome taxes, and share-based compensation expense. The decrease in cash from operating activities reflected lower net income, partially offset by timing of merchandise purchases and paymentsof accounts payable, as compared with the same period last year. The prior-year merchandise purchases were affected by the supply chaindisruptions that occurred in the preceding year. Investing Activities

 The change in investing activities primarily reflected lower capital expenditures in the current year. For the thirty-nine weeks ended October28, 2023, capital expenditures decreased by $53 million to $165 million, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. The prioryear amount was elevated as several large projects related to 2021 were paid in the first quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by otherinvesting activities related to sales of property and businesses, payments in the prior year totaling $18 million related to the WSS and atmosacquisitions, and activity related to minority investments. During the second quarter of 2023, we sold our businesses operating in Singaporeand Malaysia for total cash consideration of $24 million, or $16 million net of $8 million of cash in the business. We received $18 million in thesecond quarter and an additional $6 million in the third quarter, after net working capital adjustments to finalize the purchase price. During thethirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023, we also sold a corporate office property in North America for proceeds of $6 million. The prioryear amount represented the divestiture of Team Sales for total proceeds of $47 million. We have invested $2 million and $5 million in minority investments during the thirty-nine weeks ended October 28, 2023 and October 29,2022, respectively, with various limited partner venture capital funds managed by Black fund managers, who are committed to advancingdiverse-led businesses as part of our Leading in Education and Economic Development (LEED) initiative.

Compare rare legal repercussions for CEOs/CFOs falsifying Exhibit 31.2 vs 32 certifications.,,"Exhibit 31.2 certifications are signed under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and require the CEO and CFO to attest to the accuracy of financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal controls. False certification here can expose officers to SEC enforcement actions, civil penalties, and being barred from serving as officers or directors.

Exhibit 32 certifications are made under Section 906 of Sarbanes-Oxley (18 U.S.C. § 1350), requiring CEOs and CFOs to certify that the report complies with the Exchange Act and fairly presents the financial condition and results. Knowingly falsifying a Section 906 certification is a criminal offense and can lead to criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

In summary: Both certifications have legal consequences if falsified, but Section 906 (Exhibit 32) carries additional risk of criminal prosecution and jail time, while Section 302 (Exhibit 31.2) typically results in civil and administrative penalties.","Table of Contents

Analyze how the $0.10 quarterly dividend affects both equity classes given varying share counts and record dates.,,"The $0.10 quarterly dividend declared on both Alcoa common stock and Series A convertible preferred stock means holders of each share—regardless of class—receive $0.10 per share as of the specified record dates (August 12, 2024, and October 29, 2024). Given the outstanding share counts as of September 30, 2024—232 million common shares (basic average for Q3) and 4,041,989 Series A preferred shares—each equity class gets a pro-rata dividend:

- Common shareholders: $0.10 for each common share held on the record date.
- Series A preferred shareholders: $0.10 for each preferred share held on the record date.

Total dividend paid per class is directly proportional to the number of shares outstanding on the relevant record date. For example, with 232 million common shares and ~4.04 million preferred shares outstanding, approximately $23.2 million is distributed to common holders and about $0.40 million to preferred holders for the quarter. Exact amounts may vary with actual shares outstanding as of the record date.","12
F. Earnings Per Share 
In connection with the acquisition of Alumina Limited, on July 31, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors created and authorized 10,000,000 shares of non-
voting preferred stock designated as “Series A convertible preferred stock” with a par value of $0.01 per share. At September 30, 2024, 4,041,989 shares of 
Series A convertible preferred stock were issued and outstanding.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2024, basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, earnings are 
allocated to Alcoa common stock and preferred stock based on the pro-rata share of each class outstanding. Diluted EPS assumes the issuance of common stock 
for all potentially dilutive share equivalents outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and if-converted methods, and the more dilutive 
amount is reported.
In the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024, undistributed earnings of $1 (both periods) were allocated to preferred stock under the two-class method.
The share information used to compute basic and diluted EPS attributable to Alcoa Corporation common shareholders was as follows (shares in millions):

of common stock was anti-dilutive. Had Alcoa generated net income in the nine-month period of 2024, one million common share equivalents related to three 
million outstanding stock units and stock options combined would have been included in diluted average shares outstanding for the period.
In the third quarter and nine-month period of 2023, basic average shares outstanding and diluted average shares outstanding were the same because the effect of 
potential shares of common stock was anti-dilutive. Had Alcoa generated net income in the third quarter or nine-month period of 2023, three million common 
share equivalents (both periods) related to three million outstanding stock units and stock options combined would have been included in diluted average shares 
outstanding for the periods.|49

Alumina Limited Revolving Credit Facility
In connection with the acquisition of Alumina Limited, the Company assumed $385 of indebtedness as of August 1, 2024, representing the amount drawn on 
Alumina Limited’s revolving credit facility.
At acquisition, the Alumina Limited revolving credit facility had tranches maturing in October 2025 ($100), January 2026 ($150), July 2026 ($150), and June 
2027 ($100). In August 2024, Alcoa cancelled the undrawn portions of the revolving credit facility maturing in July 2026 ($15) and June 2027 ($100). The 
Alumina Limited revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant limiting the incurrence of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in 
compliance with such covenant.
The Alumina Limited revolving credit facility also contains a clause that allows a majority of lenders, upon a change of control, to issue a notice requiring 
repayment within 90 business days of issuing the notice (the 90-day Notice). The lenders have indicated their intention to delay issuing the 90-day Notice until 
at least December 1, 2024, providing additional time for Alcoa to consider potential repayment or refinancing options.
As of September 30, 2024, indebtedness under the Alumina Limited revolving credit facility is included in Long-term debt due within one year.
Bank Guarantee
In December 2023, AofA committed to provide a bank guarantee in connection with the approval of the Company’s five-year mine plans that were referred to 
the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency (WA EPA), which demonstrates Alcoa’s confidence that its operations will not impair drinking water 
supplies. On September 30, 2024 and October 1, 2024, AofA delivered bank guarantees totaling $69 (A$100). After March 27, 2025, Alcoa may, with the 
Western Australian government’s consent, replace the bank guarantee with a parent company guarantee or a surety bond. The requirement to provide financial 
assurance will expire upon the completion of the WA EPA’s assessment of the Company’s five-year mine plans.

Compare Alcoa’s handling of change-of-control clauses with its general approach to debt maturities.,,"Alcoa’s handling of change-of-control clauses is proactive and responsive to lender requirements. Specifically, in the case of the Alumina Limited revolving credit facility, the company acknowledges a change-of-control provision that allows a majority of lenders to require repayment within 90 business days. Alcoa has coordinated with lenders, who have agreed to delay issuing the notice until at least December 1, 2024, providing Alcoa with time to consider repayment or refinancing options.

By contrast, Alcoa’s general approach to debt maturities is structured and strategic. The company manages staggered tranche maturities—such as those in October 2025, January 2026, and July 2026—and has taken steps to reduce future obligations by cancelling undrawn portions of the facility. Alcoa also ensures compliance with financial covenants.

In summary, while Alcoa addresses change-of-control clauses through lender negotiation and contingency planning, it manages regular debt maturities by systematically scheduling repayments, cancelling unneeded commitments, and maintaining covenant compliance.","12

"Analyze how the Alumina Limited acquisition affected Alcoa’s integration, asset control, and governance simplification.",,"The acquisition of Alumina Limited, completed on August 1, 2024, significantly enhanced Alcoa’s integration, asset control, and governance simplification. By acquiring Alumina Limited (which held a 40% interest in the AWAC joint venture), Alcoa increased its economic interest and control over its bauxite and alumina assets. This vertical integration across bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum smelting allows Alcoa to better align its operations and value chain. Additionally, the consolidation of Alumina Limited into Alcoa’s structure simplified corporate governance and eliminated the complexities of joint venture management, resulting in greater strategic and financial flexibility for Alcoa. Overall, the transaction strengthened Alcoa’s position as a leading global, pure play upstream aluminum company.","30

Business Update
During the third quarter 2024, Alcoa continued to execute on its strategic priorities while progressing improvement in its operations as described below.
Alcoa completed the acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 2024. The acquisition enhances Alcoa’s position as a leading pure play, upstream aluminum 
company globally, while simplifying the Company’s corporate structure and governance, resulting in greater financial flexibility and strategic optionality.
On September 15, 2024, Alcoa announced the sale of its 25.1% interest in the Saudi Arabia joint venture to Ma’aden. This decision aligns with the Company’s 
ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and is expected to provide Alcoa with enhanced financial flexibility.
On October 16, 2024, Alcoa announced that it is progressing toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement with IGNIS EQT to support the continued 
operation of the San Ciprián complex. The proposed agreement is conditional upon delivery of key areas of cooperation with San Ciprián’s stakeholders.
During the third quarter of 2024, Alcoa continued to advance mine approvals for the next major Australian mine regions (Myara North and Holyoake) which 
were referred for accredited assessment by the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency (WA EPA) under the bilateral assessment process 
(Accredited Assessment). Alcoa is focused on modernizing its approvals framework for bauxite mining in the region and securing certainty for ongoing and 
future operations.
The Company continued to execute initiatives to further enhance its operations and reduce controllable costs during the third quarter of 2024. The Mosjøen 
smelter (Norway) and the Company’s smelters in Canada set year-to-date production records, while the Alumar smelter steadily improved stability and 
increased operating capacity to approximately 76 percent at September 30, 2024.
Saudi Arabia Joint Venture
On September 15, 2024, Alcoa entered into a share purchase and subscription agreement with Ma’aden, pursuant to which Alcoa agreed to sell its full ownership 
interest of 25.1% in the Saudi Arabia joint venture, comprised of the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company and the Ma’aden Aluminium Company, to 
Ma’aden in exchange for issuance by Ma’aden of approximately 86 million shares and $150 in cash. The implied value of the shares was $950 as of September 
12, 2024, based on the volume-weighted average share price of Ma’aden for the previous 30 calendar days. The shares of Ma’aden will be subject to transfer 
and sale restrictions. Alcoa will hold its Ma’aden shares for a minimum of three years, with one-third of the shares becoming transferable after each of the third, 
fourth, and fifth anniversaries of closing of the transaction (the holding period). During the holding period, Alcoa would be permitted to hedge and borrow 
against its Ma’aden shares. Under certain circumstances, such minimum holding period would be reduced. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, 
approval by Ma’aden’s shareholders, and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. The carrying value of Alcoa’s 
investment was $538 as of September 30, 2024.
Alumina Limited Acquisition
On August 1, 2024, Alcoa completed the acquisition of all of the ordinary shares of Alumina Limited (Alumina Shares) through a wholly owned subsidiary, 
AAC Investments Australia 2 Pty Ltd. Alumina Limited holds a 40% ownership interest in the AWAC joint venture. Under the Scheme Implementation Deed 
(the Agreement) entered into in March 2024, as amended in May 2024, holders of Alumina Shares received 0.02854 Alcoa CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs) 
for each Alumina Share (the Agreed Ratio), except that i) holders of Alumina Shares represented by American Depositary Shares, each of which represented 4 
Alumina Shares, received 0.02854 shares of Alcoa common stock and ii) a certain shareholder received, for certain of their Alumina Shares, 0.02854 shares of 
Alcoa non-voting convertible preferred stock. The Alcoa CDIs are quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange under the trading symbol AAI.
At closing, Alumina Shares outstanding of 2,760,056,014 and 141,625,403 were exchanged for 78,772,422 and 4,041,989 shares of Alcoa common stock and 
Alcoa preferred stock, respectively. Based on Alcoa’s closing share price as of July 31, 2024, the Agreed Ratio implied a value of A$1.45 per Alumina Share and 
aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $2,700 for Alumina Limited.
For Alcoa shareholders, the transaction enhances Alcoa’s vertical integration along the value chain across bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum 
smelting, increases Alcoa’s economic interest in its bauxite and alumina assets, simplifies governance, and reaffirms Alcoa’s commitment to Western Australia. 
In addition to the implied premium over prior share prices, Alumina Limited shareholders’ ownership is diversified to a large-scale, global upstream aluminum 
portfolio.|37
Noncontrolling interest
Sequential period comparison
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $11 in the second quarter of 2024. These amounts are 
entirely related to Alumina Limited’s 40% ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities prior to Alcoa’s acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 
2024. 
 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2024 reflects favorable average realized price of alumina, partially offset by elimination 
of intercompany profit in inventory. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable average realized 
price of alumina and favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments. 
Year-to-date comparison
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $(36) in the nine-month period of 2024 compared with $(45) in the nine-month period of 2023. These 
amounts are entirely related to Alumina Limited’s 40% ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities prior to Alcoa’s acquisition of Alumina Limited 
on August 1, 2024.
 
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the nine-month period of 2024 was driven by restructuring costs partially offset by favorable average realized 
price of alumina. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the nine-month period of 2023 reflects unfavorable production and raw material costs, and 
equity losses from the Ma’aden bauxite and alumina joint venture, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments. 
 
Segment Information 
Alcoa Corporation is a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company has two operating and reportable segments: (i) Alumina and (ii) 
Aluminum. Segment performance under Alcoa Corporation’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary 
measure of performance reported to the CODM is the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for each segment. The 
Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general 
administrative, and other expenses; and Research and development expenses. Alcoa Corporation’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to 
similarly titled measures of other companies. The CODM function regularly reviews the financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, of these two 
operating segments to assess performance and allocate resources.
Alumina
Business Update. The average API of $496 per metric ton trended favorably compared to the prior quarter reflecting a 27% sequential increase. Compared to the 
nine-month period of 2023, the average API trended favorably, reflecting a 20% increase year-over-year. The majority of third-party alumina sales are linked to 
the API and the favorable price trend has resulted in strong results for the segment.
Kwinana Refinery
In June 2024, Alcoa completed the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, as planned, which was announced in January 2024. As of March 2024, the refinery 
had approximately 780 employees and this number was reduced to approximately 300 in the third quarter of 2024 to manage certain processes that are expected 
to continue into 2025. At that time, the employee number will be further reduced to approximately 50. In addition to the employees separating as a result of the 
curtailment, approximately 250 employees have terminated through the productivity program announced in the third quarter of 2023 or redeployed to other 
Alcoa operations.
In the second quarter of 2024, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges of $8 related to the curtailment of the refinery including $6 for water management costs and 
$2 for contract terminations. In the first quarter of 2024, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges of $197 including $123 for water management costs, $41 for 
employee related costs, $15 for asset retirement obligations, $13 for take-or-pay contracts, and $5 for asset impairments. Related cash outlays of approximately 
$225 (which includes existing employee related liabilities and asset retirement obligations) are expected through 2025, with approximately $145 to be spent in 
2024. The Company spent $72 and $96 against the reserve in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024, respectively.|15

12, 2024, based on the volume-weighted average share price of Ma’aden for the previous 30 calendar days. The shares of Ma’aden will be subject to transfer 
and sale restrictions. Alcoa will hold its Ma’aden shares for a minimum of three years, with one-third of the shares becoming transferable after each of the third, 
fourth, and fifth anniversaries of closing of the transaction (the holding period). During the holding period, Alcoa would be permitted to hedge and borrow 
against its Ma’aden shares. Under certain circumstances, such minimum holding period would be reduced. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, 
approval by Ma’aden’s shareholders, and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. The carrying value of Alcoa’s 
investment was $538 as of September 30, 2024.
Alumina Limited Acquisition
On August 1, 2024, Alcoa completed the acquisition of all of the ordinary shares of Alumina Limited (Alumina Shares) through a wholly owned subsidiary, 
AAC Investments Australia 2 Pty Ltd. Alumina Limited holds a 40% ownership interest in the AWAC joint venture. Under the Scheme Implementation Deed 
(the Agreement) entered into in March 2024, as amended in May 2024, holders of Alumina Shares received 0.02854 Alcoa CHESS Depositary Interests (CDIs) 
for each Alumina Share (the Agreed Ratio), except that i) holders of Alumina Shares represented by American Depositary Shares, each of which represented 4 
Alumina Shares, received 0.02854 shares of Alcoa common stock and ii) a certain shareholder received, for certain of their Alumina Shares, 0.02854 shares of 
Alcoa non-voting convertible preferred stock. The Alcoa CDIs are quoted on the Australian Stock Exchange under the trading symbol AAI.
At closing, Alumina Shares outstanding of 2,760,056,014 and 141,625,403 were exchanged for 78,772,422 and 4,041,989 shares of Alcoa common stock and 
Alcoa preferred stock, respectively. Based on Alcoa’s closing share price as of July 31, 2024, the Agreed Ratio implied a value of A$1.45 per Alumina Share and 
aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $2,700 for Alumina Limited.
For Alcoa shareholders, the transaction enhances Alcoa’s vertical integration along the value chain across bauxite mining, alumina refining, and aluminum 
smelting, increases Alcoa’s economic interest in its bauxite and alumina assets, simplifies governance, and reaffirms Alcoa’s commitment to Western Australia. 
In addition to the implied premium over prior share prices, Alumina Limited shareholders’ ownership is diversified to a large-scale, global upstream aluminum 
portfolio.|37
Noncontrolling interest
Sequential period comparison
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $8 in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $11 in the second quarter of 2024. These amounts are 
entirely related to Alumina Limited’s 40% ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities prior to Alcoa’s acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 
2024. 
 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the third quarter of 2024 reflects favorable average realized price of alumina, partially offset by elimination 
of intercompany profit in inventory. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the second quarter of 2024 was driven by favorable average realized 
price of alumina and favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments. 
Year-to-date comparison
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was $(36) in the nine-month period of 2024 compared with $(45) in the nine-month period of 2023. These 
amounts are entirely related to Alumina Limited’s 40% ownership interest in several affiliated operating entities prior to Alcoa’s acquisition of Alumina Limited 
on August 1, 2024.
 
Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the nine-month period of 2024 was driven by restructuring costs partially offset by favorable average realized 
price of alumina. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the nine-month period of 2023 reflects unfavorable production and raw material costs, and 
equity losses from the Ma’aden bauxite and alumina joint venture, partially offset by favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments. 
 
Segment Information 
Alcoa Corporation is a producer of bauxite, alumina, and aluminum products. The Company has two operating and reportable segments: (i) Alumina and (ii) 
Aluminum. Segment performance under Alcoa Corporation’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary 
measure of performance reported to the CODM is the Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for each segment. The 
Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general 
administrative, and other expenses; and Research and development expenses. Alcoa Corporation’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to 
similarly titled measures of other companies. The CODM function regularly reviews the financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, of these two 
operating segments to assess performance and allocate resources.
Alumina
Business Update. The average API of $496 per metric ton trended favorably compared to the prior quarter reflecting a 27% sequential increase. Compared to the 
nine-month period of 2023, the average API trended favorably, reflecting a 20% increase year-over-year. The majority of third-party alumina sales are linked to 
the API and the favorable price trend has resulted in strong results for the segment.
Kwinana Refinery
In June 2024, Alcoa completed the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, as planned, which was announced in January 2024. As of March 2024, the refinery 
had approximately 780 employees and this number was reduced to approximately 300 in the third quarter of 2024 to manage certain processes that are expected 
to continue into 2025. At that time, the employee number will be further reduced to approximately 50. In addition to the employees separating as a result of the 
curtailment, approximately 250 employees have terminated through the productivity program announced in the third quarter of 2023 or redeployed to other 
Alcoa operations.
In the second quarter of 2024, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges of $8 related to the curtailment of the refinery including $6 for water management costs and 
$2 for contract terminations. In the first quarter of 2024, Alcoa recorded restructuring charges of $197 including $123 for water management costs, $41 for 
employee related costs, $15 for asset retirement obligations, $13 for take-or-pay contracts, and $5 for asset impairments. Related cash outlays of approximately 
$225 (which includes existing employee related liabilities and asset retirement obligations) are expected through 2025, with approximately $145 to be spent in 
2024. The Company spent $72 and $96 against the reserve in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024, respectively.|15

On September 15, 2024, Alcoa entered into a share purchase and subscription agreement with Ma’aden, pursuant to which Alcoa agreed to sell its full ownership 
interest of 25.1% in the Saudi Arabia joint venture, comprised of the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company and the Ma’aden Aluminium Company, to 
Ma’aden in exchange for issuance by Ma’aden of 85,977,547 shares and $150 in cash (see Note C).
The results for the Saudi Arabia joint venture for the nine-month period of 2023 include an adjustment to the estimate for the settlement of a dispute with an 
industrial utility for periods in 2021 and 2022. Alcoa’s share of this adjustment is $41 which is included in Other expenses, net on the Statement of Consolidated 
Operations for the nine-month period of 2023. Alcoa’s total share of this dispute of $62 includes $21 that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.",./dataset_3/10qpt4\17ba243a-88ac-4472-b7e9-d7cdf49a6f99.pdf
Evaluate long-term economic impacts of phased workforce reductions after Kwinana refinery full decommissioning.,,"The phased workforce reductions at the Kwinana refinery following its full curtailment are expected to have several long-term economic impacts:

1. **Cost Savings for Alcoa:** The stepwise reduction from approximately 780 employees to 50 by 2025 will significantly lower ongoing payroll and associated operational expenses, aligning with Alcoa’s initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and reduce controllable costs.

2. **Restructuring Charges and Cash Outlays:** Alcoa has already recorded substantial restructuring charges ($205 million in 2024) and anticipates related cash outlays of around $225 million through 2025. These one-time costs are expected to lead to long-term savings beyond 2025 as obligations decrease.

3. **Local Economic Impact:** The loss of several hundred jobs may negatively affect the regional economy through reduced household income, consumer spending, and potential increases in unemployment. While some employees have been redeployed, the overall reduction could challenge local businesses and government revenue.

4. **Operational Focus Shift:** The workforce reduction and curtailment free up resources for Alcoa to concentrate on more profitable or strategic assets, supporting its broader goals of streamlining operations and maintaining flexibility, as evidenced by concurrent asset acquisition and divestiture activities.

5. **Long-Term Financial Flexibility:** By reducing ongoing commitments at Kwinana and eliminating associated overheads, Alcoa positions itself for greater financial flexibility, enabling reinvestment in core operations or new growth areas.

In summary, while there are near-term costs and potential regional socio-economic drawbacks, the phased workforce reductions are likely to yield enduring operational efficiencies and cost savings for Alcoa.","30

(mdmt))
Business Update
During the third quarter 2024, Alcoa continued to execute on its strategic priorities while progressing improvement in its operations as described below.
Alcoa completed the acquisition of Alumina Limited on August 1, 2024. The acquisition enhances Alcoa’s position as a leading pure play, upstream aluminum 
company globally, while simplifying the Company’s corporate structure and governance, resulting in greater financial flexibility and strategic optionality.
On September 15, 2024, Alcoa announced the sale of its 25.1% interest in the Saudi Arabia joint venture to Ma’aden. This decision aligns with the Company’s 
ongoing efforts to streamline its operations and is expected to provide Alcoa with enhanced financial flexibility.
On October 16, 2024, Alcoa announced that it is progressing toward entering into a strategic cooperation agreement with IGNIS EQT to support the continued 
operation of the San Ciprián complex. The proposed agreement is conditional upon delivery of key areas of cooperation with San Ciprián’s stakeholders.
During the third quarter of 2024, Alcoa continued to advance mine approvals for the next major Australian mine regions (Myara North and Holyoake) which 
were referred for accredited assessment by the Western Australia Environmental Protection Agency (WA EPA) under the bilateral assessment process 
(Accredited Assessment). Alcoa is focused on modernizing its approvals framework for bauxite mining in the region and securing certainty for ongoing and 
future operations.
The Company continued to execute initiatives to further enhance its operations and reduce controllable costs during the third quarter of 2024. The Mosjøen 
smelter (Norway) and the Company’s smelters in Canada set year-to-date production records, while the Alumar smelter steadily improved stability and 
increased operating capacity to approximately 76 percent at September 30, 2024.
Saudi Arabia Joint Venture
On September 15, 2024, Alcoa entered into a share purchase and subscription agreement with Ma’aden, pursuant to which Alcoa agreed to sell its full ownership 
interest of 25.1% in the Saudi Arabia joint venture, comprised of the Ma’aden Bauxite and Alumina Company and the Ma’aden Aluminium Company, to 
Ma’aden in exchange for issuance by Ma’aden of approximately 86 million shares and $150 in cash. The implied value of the shares was $950 as of September 
12, 2024, based on the volume-weighted average share price of Ma’aden for the previous 30 calendar days. The shares of Ma’aden will be subject to transfer 
and sale restrictions. Alcoa will hold its Ma’aden shares for a minimum of three years, with one-third of the shares becoming transferable after each of the third, 
fourth, and fifth anniversaries of closing of the transaction (the holding period). During the holding period, Alcoa would be permitted to hedge and borrow 
against its Ma’aden shares. Under certain circumstances, such minimum holding period would be reduced. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, 
approval by Ma’aden’s shareholders, and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2025. The carrying value of Alcoa’s 
investment was $538 as of September 30, 2024.

Which specific site closures or curtailments and related cash spent drove 2023-2024 Alcoa restructuring charges?,,"The primary site closures and curtailments driving Alcoa’s 2023-2024 restructuring charges were:

- **Kwinana (Australia) refinery curtailment (2024):** Curtailed in June 2024, incurring $205 in charges, including $129 for water management, $41 for severance and employee termination (430 employees), asset retirement obligations, contract costs, etc. Related cash outlays are expected to total $225 through 2025 (about $145 in 2024); $72 was spent in Q3 2024, and $96 for the nine months ended Q3 2024.

- **Intalco (Washington) aluminum smelter permanent closure (2023):** Closed in 2023, incurring $101 in restructuring charges for asset impairments, environmental, demolition, and employee severance costs. Cash outlays for this closure are projected at $85 over three years (about $45 in 2024); $1 was spent in Q3 2024 and $14 year-to-date.

These closures and the associated employee costs, environmental, and contract obligations were the main drivers of restructuring charges and related cash spending in 2023–2024.","36
Year-to-date comparison
Other expenses (income), net was $49 in the nine-month period of 2024 compared with $145 in the nine-month period of 2023. The favorable change of $96 
was primarily a result of:
• Decrease in equity losses from the Ma’aden aluminum joint venture primarily due to the absence of a charge for a utility settlement and higher shipments 
• Favorable mark-to-market results on derivative instruments primarily due to higher power prices in the current year
• Decrease in equity losses from the Ma’aden bauxite and alumina joint venture primarily due to higher alumina prices, higher shipments and lower 
production costs
• Lower ELYSIS capital contributions, reducing loss recognition
Partially offset by:
• Unfavorable currency revaluation impacts primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real in the current year, partially offset by the 
absence of gains recognized in the prior year due to the U.S. dollar weakening against the Brazilian real

D. Restructuring and Other Charges, Net
 
In the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2024, Alcoa Corporation recorded Restructuring and other charges, net, of $30 and $250, respectively, which 
were primarily comprised of:
• A charge of $205 (nine-month period only), for the curtailment of the Kwinana (Australia) refinery;
• A charge of $4 and $16, respectively, for take-or-pay contract costs at the closed Wenatchee (Washington) smelter; 
• A net charge of $14 and $15, respectively, to record additional environmental and asset retirement obligation reserves at previously closed locations (see 
Note O); and,
• A charge of $12 (both periods) for contract termination costs at the Intalco (Washington) aluminum smelter.
In June 2024, Alcoa completed the full curtailment of the Kwinana refinery, as planned, which was announced in January 2024. As of March 2024, the refinery 
had approximately 780 employees and this number was reduced to approximately 300 in the third quarter of 2024 to manage certain processes that are expected 
to continue into 2025. At that time, the employee number will be further reduced to approximately 50. In addition to the employees separating as a result of the 
curtailment, approximately 250 employees have terminated through the productivity program announced in the third quarter of 2023 or redeployed to other 
Alcoa operations. Approximately 50 additional employees are expected to redeploy to other Alcoa operations. Charges related to the curtailment totaled $205 in 
the nine-month period of 2024 and included charges of $129 for water management costs, $41 for severance and employee termination costs for the separation 
of approximately 430 employees, $15 for asset retirement obligations, $13 for take-or-pay contracts, $5 for asset impairments and $2 for contract terminations.
Related cash outlays of approximately $225 (which includes existing employee related liabilities and asset retirement obligations) are expected through 2025, 
with approximately $145 to be spent in 2024. The Company spent $72 and $96 against the reserve in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024, 
respectively.
In the third quarter and the nine-month period of 2023, Alcoa Corporation recorded Restructuring and other charges, net, of $22 and $195, respectively, which 
were primarily comprised of:
• A charge of $101 (nine-month period only) for asset impairments and to establish reserves for environmental, demolition and employee severance costs 
related to the permanent closure of the Intalco aluminum smelter;
• A charge of $47 (nine-month period only) for increased reserves for certain employee obligations related to the updated viability agreement for the San 
Ciprián (Spain) aluminum smelter;
• A charge of $21 (nine-month period only) related to the settlement of certain pension benefits;
• A net charge of $15 (both periods) to record additional environmental and asset retirement obligation reserves at previously closed locations; and,
• A charge of $7 and $10, respectively, for employee termination and severance costs primarily related to the Kwinana refinery productivity program.
In September 2023, the Company continued to pursue cost reduction measures and initiated productivity programs across its operations in Australia to mitigate 
the financial impacts of lower grade bauxite and to optimize current operating levels. In connection with this program, the Company recorded Restructuring and 
other charges, net of $6 for employee termination and severance costs for approximately 90 employees at the Kwinana refinery. This program was completed in 
September 2024.
In March 2023, Alcoa Corporation announced the closure of the Intalco aluminum smelter, which had been fully curtailed since 2020. The Company recorded 
charges of $117 related to the closure, including a charge of $16 in Cost of goods sold on the Statement of Consolidated Operations to write-down remaining 
inventories to net realizable value and a charge of $101 in Restructuring and other charges, net on the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The restructuring 
charges were comprised of asset impairments of $50, environmental and demolition obligation reserves of $50, and severance and employee termination costs 
of $1 for the separation of approximately 12 employees. Cash outlays related to the permanent closure of the site are expected to be $85 over the next three 
years with approximately $45 to be spent in 2024. The Company spent $1 and $14 against the reserve in the third quarter and nine-month period of 2024, 
respectively.",./dataset_3/10qpt4\17ba243a-88ac-4472-b7e9-d7cdf49a6f99.pdf
"How did changes in raw material, energy, and alumina prices affect COGS/sales % vs 2023?",,"Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased by 6% year-to-date compared to 2023, primarily due to favorable raw material costs, higher average realized price of alumina, and lower energy costs across both segments.

"How do CEO/Prez powers over signing, delegation, appointments adapt if Board changes officers?",,"If the Board of Directors changes officers, the signing, delegation, and appointment powers of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and President pass to the new individuals elected to those offices. The Board has authority to elect and remove officers, and vacancies are filled by the Board (Sections 4.02–4.04). The executive powers—including signing documents, delegating authority, and appointing agents and employees—are attached to the office, not the individual (Sections 4.05, 5.01). Thus, when officers change, these powers are exercised by the successors as provided by the by-laws and subject to any Board

"Explain how the Secretary's duties interrelate across recordkeeping, issuing notices, share certs., and delegation.",,"The Secretary’s duties are interrelated across several areas:

- **Recordkeeping:** The Secretary keeps minutes of shareholder and Board meetings in official books and manages the corporation’s records and seal.

- **Issuing Notices:** The Secretary ensures all required notices are properly given in accordance with the by-laws or law, using the shareholders’ address register, which the Secretary maintains.

- **Share Certificates:** The Secretary signs share certificates, together with the CEO/president or a vice president, after Board authorization, and manages the stock transfer books.

- **Delegation:** The Secretary’s responsibilities can include additional duties or authority delegated by the CEO, President, or Board.

These functions support each other: accurate records ensure proper notice delivery, the register of addresses supports both notice and share certificate processes, and delegated duties allow flexibility depending on the needs of the corporation.","sign, execute and acknowledge, on behalf of the corporation, all deeds, mortgages, bonds, stock certificates, contracts, leases, reports and all other documents orinstruments necessary or proper to be executed in the course of the ordinary business of the corporation, or which shall be authorized by resolution of the Boardof Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Board of Directors, either of them also may authorize any Vice President or other officer or agent of thecorporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such documents or instruments in his place and stead. Each shall have authority, subject to such rules as may beprescribed by the Board of Directors, to appoint such agents and employees of the corporation as he or she shall deem necessary, to prescribe their powers,duties and compensation, and to delegate authority to them. Such agents and employees shall hold office at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer and thePresident.4.06The Vice Presidents

How do BoD unanimous written consent and officer signature rules interact in corporate actions?,,"Board of Directors (BoD) unanimous written consent allows the BoD to take action without a meeting if all directors sign a written consent detailing the action (section 3.14). Once approved, officers can execute documents or contracts reflecting that action, following prescribed signature rules. Specifically, unless otherwise designated, principal documents are signed by the Chief Executive Officer or President—sometimes with a second officer such as the Secretary (section 5.01). Third parties may rely on such officer signatures as conclusive evidence of authority. In summary, the BoD authorizes the action by unanimous written consent, and officers sign and execute the necessary documents in accordance with the corporation’s bylaws.","sign, execute and acknowledge, on behalf of the corporation, all deeds, mortgages, bonds, stock certificates, contracts, leases, reports and all other documents orinstruments necessary or proper to be executed in the course of the ordinary business of the corporation, or which shall be authorized by resolution of the Boardof Directors. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Board of Directors, either of them also may authorize any Vice President or other officer or agent of thecorporation to sign, execute and acknowledge such documents or instruments in his place and stead. Each shall have authority, subject to such rules as may beprescribed by the Board of Directors, to appoint such agents and employees of the corporation as he or she shall deem necessary, to prescribe their powers,duties and compensation, and to delegate authority to them. Such agents and employees shall hold office at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer and thePresident.4.06The Vice Presidents

Examine implied amendment impacts on indemnification clauses for directors in WI corporations.,,"Implied amendments, as described in Section 8.03, mean that any action by shareholders or the Board that is inconsistent with existing by-laws—but taken with the required affirmative vote to amend the by-laws—will have the same effect as a temporary amendment or suspension of the by-laws to permit that specific action. 

This impacts indemnification clauses (Article VII) by allowing the corporation to effectively adjust indemnification provisions for directors (and officers or employees) without formally amending the by-laws, provided the action is taken with the requisite voting threshold. Thus, directors' indemnification rights could be temporarily broadened, limited, or otherwise modified for specific situations, as long as the necessary approvals are obtained. This ensures flexibility while still protecting the director’s contractual indemnification rights as set forth in Article VII.","has notice that such shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, and (b) files with the corporation a sufficient indemnity bond, and (c) satisfied suchother reasonable requirements as may be prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.6.07Consideration for Shares

"How do by-law amendment powers compare between shareholders and directors, particularly regarding imposed restrictions?",,"Both shareholders and the Board of Directors have the power to alter, amend, or repeal the by-laws, as well as adopt new by-laws. Shareholders can do so by an affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the shares present or represented and entitled to vote (Section 8.01). Directors can also amend by-laws by a majority vote at a meeting with a quorum (Section 8.02). However, if a by-law adopted by shareholders specifically states that it cannot be amended or repealed by the Board, then the Board is restricted and cannot change that by-law. Thus, shareholders can impose limitations on the Board’s by-law amendment powers.","has notice that such shares have been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, and (b) files with the corporation a sufficient indemnity bond, and (c) satisfied suchother reasonable requirements as may be prescribed by or under the authority of the Board of Directors.6.07Consideration for Shares

How do unforeseeable regulatory shifts uniquely impact long-term forecast reliability in volatile industries?,,"Unforeseeable regulatory shifts introduce additional risks and uncertainties that can significantly undermine the reliability of long-term forecasts in volatile industries. Since forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and available information, sudden regulatory changes—which are difficult to predict—may cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those anticipated. This is especially relevant in highly competitive and rapidly changing environments, where not all risks and uncertainties can be foreseen or accounted for in forecasts.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
We enter into financial derivative instruments, consisting of foreign currency contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk of
our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative
purposes. These instruments are recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified within Level 2 of the fair

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Non-Marketable Equity Securities
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The
14|carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or
similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are
recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Certain non-marketable equity securities
are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these securities based on valuation methods,
including the common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method and option-pricing model (“OPM”), using the transaction price of similar securities
issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and obligations of the securities we hold.
The following table summarizes the total carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis held, including cumulative unrealized upward and downward adjustments made to the initial cost basis of the securities (in

Share Repurchase Program
In February 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock (the
“Share Repurchase Program”). The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are determined by the discretion of management,
depending on market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made through open market purchases and accelerated share
repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on market conditions and other
factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice.
In January 2025, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large financial institution
to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our previously announced Share Repurchase Program. The transactions
under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025.
During the three months ended March 31, 2025, we repurchased, and subsequently retired, 26.6 million shares of common stock, for
$1.8 billion, excluding broker commissions and fees. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $4.0 billion available to repurchase shares
pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.
The Inflation Reduction Act imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases. During the three
months ended March 31, 2025, the excise tax on net share repurchases was not material.

In Q1 2025, fair value changes contributed to unrealized gains, with a $155 million gain on Didi and a $137 million gain on Aurora, partially offset by a $102 million loss on Grab. These specific changes were major drivers of the shift from a net unrealized loss of $721 million in Q1 2024 to a net unrealized gain of $51 million in Q1 2025.","Accrued and Other Current Liabilities

Delivery Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue including advertising, partially offset by a
$178 million increase in Courier payments and incentives recorded in Delivery Platform Participant direct transaction costs, a $48 million
increase in employee headcount costs, a $42 million increase in indirect advertising and marketing, a $17 million increase in insurance
expense primarily due to an increase in miles driven, and a $15 million increase in credit card processing costs as a result of increased Gross
Bookings, recorded in Delivery other expense.
Freight Segment
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, Freight revenue decreased $24 million, or 2%,
and Freight Adjusted EBITDA improved $14 million, or 67%.
Freight revenue decreased primarily attributable to a 2% decrease in Freight Gross Bookings due to lower revenue per load as a result of
the challenging freight market cycle.
Freight Adjusted EBITDA improved primarily attributable to a $24 million decrease in Freight Carrier payments recorded in Freight
Platform Participant direct transaction costs and a $13 million decrease in Freight other expenses, partially offset by a $24 million decrease in
revenue.
Certain Key Metrics
Monthly Active Platform Consumers. MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery
order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple
product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the
adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.

Highlights for the First Quarter 2025
In the first quarter of 2025, our MAPCs were 170 million, growing 14% compared to the same period in 2024.
Overall Gross Bookings increased to $42.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, up 14%, or 18% on a constant currency basis, compared to
the same period in 2024. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 20% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to an increase in
Mobility Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 18% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in
Delivery Trip volumes. Freight Gross Bookings decreased 1% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis.
Revenue was $11.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 14%. The increase in
Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility and Delivery Trip volumes.
Net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $1.8 billion, which includes the favorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized gain on
debt and equity securities, net of $51 million primarily related to changes in the fair value of our equity securities, including: a $155 million
unrealized gain on our Didi investment, a $137 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, partially offset by a $102 million
unrealized loss on our Grab investment, and a $139 million net unrealized loss on our other investments.
Adjusted EBITDA was $1.9 billion, up $486 million compared to the same period in 2024. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion,
up $274 million compared to the same period in 2024. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA was $763 million, up $235 million compared to the same
period in 2024. These increases were partially offset by a $37 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs, year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with $6.0 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.
Share Repurchase Program
In January 2025, we announced that we entered into an accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreement with a large financial institution
to repurchase $1.5 billion of our outstanding common stock as part of our previously announced Share Repurchase Program. The transactions
under the ASR agreement were completed during the first quarter of 2025. For additional information, see Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity in
the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that
we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net
of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and
Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service. In certain markets we are responsible for the Mobility or Delivery
services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets we present revenue from end-users and from
Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and
amortization.

Analyze the rarest drivers impacting Freight segment’s Adjusted EBITDA improvement despite revenue decline in Q1 2025.,,"Freight segment’s Adjusted EBITDA improved by $14 million (67%) in Q1 2025 despite a 2% revenue decline, primarily due to a $24 million decrease in Freight Carrier payments and a $13 million decrease in other expenses. These cost reductions more than offset the $24 million revenue drop, making cost control—especially lower Carrier payments—the rarest and most significant driver of EBITDA improvement in a challenging freight market.","Mobility Adjusted EBITDA increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings, partially offset by a $238 million

"Compare how revenue, participant costs, and incentives affected Adj. EBITDA in Mobility, Delivery, vs. Freight.",,"Mobility’s Adjusted EBITDA increased 19%, primarily due to a 15% revenue increase from higher Gross Bookings and trip volumes. This was partially offset by higher participant costs and incentives, including a $238M rise in driver payments/incentives, a $197M increase in insurance, and increases in network, credit card, and headcount costs.

Delivery’s Adjusted EBITDA rose 45%, driven by an 18% revenue increase (mainly from higher Delivery Gross Bookings and $124M more in advertising revenue). This was partially offset by a $178M increase in courier payments/incentives, higher headcount, advertising, insurance, and credit card costs.

Freight’s Adjusted EBITDA improved 67% despite a 2% revenue decline. This improvement was mainly due to a $24M decrease in carrier payments and a $13M reduction in other expenses, which more than offset the lower revenue.

Compare how current vs. future debt and restrictive covenants differently impact operational and financial flexibility.,,"Current debt of $9.6 billion as of March 31, 2025, already requires significant cash outflows for interest and principal payments, directly reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes. Existing debt agreements also impose restrictive covenants, such as limits on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, certain consolidations, mergers, sales of assets, and restrictions on dividends, thereby restricting operational and financial flexibility.

Future debt could further exacerbate these constraints. If additional debt is incurred—such as for financing the purchase of autonomous vehicles—it may come with new or more stringent restrictive covenants, increasing limitations on capital-raising, expansion, and other financial or operational activities. This could further reduce flexibility, particularly if future debt is more expensive or difficult to refinance, or if it triggers tighter restrictions that make it harder to pursue business opportunities, respond to industry changes, or secure additional financing. In summary, while current debt and covenants already constrain flexibility, additional and potentially more restrictive future debt could significantly heighten these limitations.","We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such
indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our
business.
As of March 31, 2025, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.6 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to
approximately $128 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of March 31, 2025.
Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure
existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous
vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.
We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such
payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to
obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our
ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy,
limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business
opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing
will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our
operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to
generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.
In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our
business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers,
and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve
additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under
our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in
turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.
In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section
titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”
We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different
companies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we
currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign
jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our
compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes.
Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes
prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially
adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.”
Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue
to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the
payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.
Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge
our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position
and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the
valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are
subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and currently face
numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our
financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities
requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination
remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our
financial results in the
66|Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant
out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict
our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete
acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt
securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions
successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.
In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired
businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or AI risks associated with such
acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with
certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our
data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationships with
government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us.
The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks
and challenges, including:
• diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;
• disrupting our ongoing business operations;
• platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;
• implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;
• integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements
and timelines;
• retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees,
managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with
eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;
• maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;
• integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;
• integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;
• liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;
• litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and
• impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.
We have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating
functions. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be
impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.
In addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar
laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt
practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.
We may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these
transactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures,
or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of
which may adversely affect our reputation and our business. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a
transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.
We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.
Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific
dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases
are determined at the discretion of our management, depending on market conditions and other factors. We cannot guarantee that the program
will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value, and it may
68|period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot
accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In
addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other
arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than
our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased
effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to
establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.
Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. We are unable to predict what
other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our business.
Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax
liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash
flows, and effective tax rates where we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and
cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.
The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental bodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation
is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations
described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the
countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and
expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide
effective tax rate and harm our financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $176 million that begin to expire in 2031 and $8.2
billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $7.5 billion
that started expiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of $759 million that started expiring in 2024 and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. Realization of
these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire
unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In
addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50%
change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net
operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-
ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership
change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net
taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal
and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report
our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary,
revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and
liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. Although we have entered into and may in
the future enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in
our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience
establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.
If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed,
and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint
ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary
companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even
if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may
not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including
one of our competitors.

How might new DSTs and NOL carryforward restrictions affect a $9.6B debt-laden multinational’s cash flow?,,"New digital services taxes (DSTs) could significantly increase the tax obligations of a $9.6B debt-laden multinational, raising its effective tax rate and reducing available cash flow for debt service, operations, and investment. Additionally, if limitations or expirations on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards occur—either through legislative change or ownership changes—future taxable income may not be offset as planned, resulting in higher tax payments. Both factors may further strain cash flows, limit financial flexibility, and harm financial position and operating results.","We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such

How can integration failures in cross-border M&A lead to increased indirect tax liabilities and post-deal financial impairments?,,"Integration failures in cross-border M&A can lead to increased indirect tax liabilities and post-deal financial impairments because acquired businesses may have differing licenses and arrangements that are less tax efficient or potentially non-compliant with local tax rules.

and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve
additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under
our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans immediately, and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which in
turn may have an adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.
In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which is discussed in greater detail under the section
titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.”
We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities.
The tax laws applicable to our global business activities are subject to uncertainty and can be interpreted differently by different
companies. For example, we may become subject to sales tax rates in certain jurisdictions that are significantly greater than the rates we
currently pay in those jurisdictions. Like many other multinational corporations, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign
jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Currently, certain jurisdictions are investigating our
compliance with tax rules. If it is determined that we are not compliant with such rules, we could owe additional taxes.
Certain jurisdictions, including Australia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the UK and other countries, require that we pay any assessed taxes
prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of tax assessments in those jurisdictions. These amounts could materially
adversely impact our liquidity while those matters are being litigated. This prepayment of contested taxes is referred to as “pay-to-play.”
Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes; even when such payments are made, we continue
to defend our positions vigorously. If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the
payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.
Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge
our methodologies for valuing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position
and operating results. Furthermore, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the
valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are
subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and currently face
numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our
financial position and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities
requires significant judgment by our management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination
remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our
financial results in the
66|Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management’s time and significant
out-of-pocket costs. We may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict
our business or require the use of available cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete
acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt
securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions
successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be harmed.
In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired
businesses and technologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy, data security or AI risks associated with such
acquisitions, may harm our operating results and expansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with
certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our
data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem’s business, and doing so may cause our relationships with
government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing fines or penalties against us.
The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology or acquired personnel into our company is subject to various risks
and challenges, including:
• diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration;
• disrupting our ongoing business operations;
• platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings;
• implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company;
• integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring the acquired business meets our financial reporting requirements
and timelines;
• retaining and integrating acquired employees, including aligning incentives between acquired employees and existing employees,
managing cultural differences between acquired businesses and our business, as well as managing costs associated with
eliminating redundancies or transferring employees on acceptable terms with minimal business disruption;
• maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business;
• integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;
• integrating companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience;
• liability for pre-acquisition activities of the acquired company;
• litigation or other claims or liabilities arising in connection with the acquisition or the acquired company; and
• impairment charges associated with goodwill, long-lived assets, investments, and other acquired intangible assets.
We have in the past and may in the future implement integration structures that do not fully integrate an acquired company’s operating
functions. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be
impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company’s brand.
In addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar
laws outside the United States. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt
practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.
We may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these
transactions will be accretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures,
or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of
which may adversely affect our reputation and our business. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a
transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.
We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value.
Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program, the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific
dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases
are determined at the discretion of our management, depending on market conditions and other factors. We cannot guarantee that the program
will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value, and it may
68|period or periods for which such determination is made. Our tax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot
accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future, which could impact our financial position. In
addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing licenses and other
arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm’s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than
our licenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased
effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to
establish a reserve in our consolidated financial statements, and could adversely affect our financial results.
Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.
We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. We are unable to predict what
other global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our business.
Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax
liability that we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash
flows, and effective tax rates where we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and
cost of tax compliance. We could become subject to new or additional digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.
The governments of countries in which we operate and other governmental bodies could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation
is determined in their jurisdictions that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations
described above in our income tax returns filed in such jurisdictions. New laws could significantly increase our tax obligations in the
countries in which we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. As a result of the large and
expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide
effective tax rate and harm our financial position, operating results, and cash flows.
Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.
As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $176 million that begin to expire in 2031 and $8.2
billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $7.5 billion
that started expiring in 2024 and $1.6 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2024, we had foreign net operating
loss carryforwards of $759 million that started expiring in 2024 and $19.2 billion that have an unlimited carryover period. Realization of
these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire
unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In
addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50%
change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net
operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-
ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership
change. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net
taxable income, our ability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal
and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.
We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report
our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary,
revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and
liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results. Although we have entered into and may in
the future enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in
our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have limited experience
establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating
results.
If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed,
and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint
ventures, divest portions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary
companies or technologies. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even
if we are able to identify a target for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may
not be able to receive approval from the applicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including
one of our competitors.
